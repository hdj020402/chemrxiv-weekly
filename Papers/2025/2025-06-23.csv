Ligands were derived by segmenting purely two-dimensional SMILES representations, and metal-ligand interactions were modeled using a Transformer-like architecture to construct a property prediction framework that aligns closely with chemical knowledge. This approach effectively captures the characteristics of ligand field within TMCs. Consequently, the SLEET model delivers precise HOMO-LUMO gap predictions comparable to those achieved by three-dimensional information-based models, while also demonstrates strong performance in predicting the molecular-weight-independent electronic properties.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Transition Metal Complexes (Organomet.),2025-06-19T06:07:38.155Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684fc58d3ba0887c33d4ba55/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684f86e8c1cb1ecda04277ab/original/feature-driven-prediction-of-homo-lumo-gaps-in-transition-metal-complexes-using-the-sleet-model-a-smiles-based-transformer-framework.pdf

Synthetic data generation is becoming a foundational strategy for advancing model accuracy and enabling fast discovery workflows. To support the development of structure elucidation and spectral property prediction models, we present a comprehensive synthetic dataset of infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra for a diverse ensemble of organic molecules. The data were generated using a hybrid computational approach that integrates molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and machine learning (ML) models. The dataset primarily consists of IR spectra for 177,461 molecules, derived from long-timescale MD simulations with ML-accelerated dipole moment predictions. In addition, it includes a smaller subset of 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR chemical shifts for 1,255 molecules. This unique combination of spectral data offers a valuable resource for benchmarking and validating computational methodologies, developing and enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) models for molecular property prediction, and facilitating the interpretation of experimental spectroscopic results.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bk2rh-v2,GoFlow: Efficient Transition State Geometry Prediction with Flow Matching and E(3)-Equivariant Neural Networks,"Transition state (TS) geometries of chemical reactions are key to understanding reaction mechanisms and estimating kinetic properties. Inferring these directly from 2D reaction graphs offers chemists a powerful tool for rapid and accessible reaction analysis. Quantum chemical methods for computing TSs are computationally intensive and often infeasible for larger molecular systems. Recently, deep learning–based diffusion models have shown promise in generating TSs from 2D reaction graphs for single-step reactions. However, framing TS generation as a diffusion process, by design, requires a prohibitively large number of sampling steps during inference. Here we show that modeling TS generation as an optimal transport flow problem, solved via E(3)-equivariant flow matching with geometric tensor networks, achieves over a hundredfold speedup in inference while improving geometric accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. This breakthrough increase in sampling efficiency and predictive accuracy enables the practical use of deep learning-based TS generators in high-throughput settings for larger and more complex chemical systems. Our method, GoFlow, thus represents a significant methodological advancement in machine learning-based TS generation, bringing it closer to widespread use in computational chemistry workflows.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-06-18T07:12:26.993Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6850098f3ba0887c33dbd713/original/go-flow-efficient-transition-state-geometry-prediction-with-flow-matching-and-e-3-equivariant-neural-networks.pdf

Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative to \textit{ab initio} methods; however, developing broadly applicable reactive MLPs remains challenging due to inherent chemical complexity. Here, we present a scalable workflow for developing reactive MLPs specifically tailored to C, H, O, N-containing systems.  Our approach involves constructing a large-scale pre-training dataset of over 17 million non-equilibrium structures along chemical reaction pathways, generated by combining the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method and structure alignment algorithms, with energies and forces labelled at the semi-empirical level.  Subsequently, a high-precision fine-tuning dataset containing over 200,000 structures was efficiently built at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level by integrating active learning methods.  An array of model architectures and training paradigms, including pretraining-finetuning and transfer learning frameworks, were systematically benchmarked through rigorous evaluations. Through this process, we developed an optimized MLP model demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both predictive accuracy and generalization capability for reactive chemical environments involving C, H, O, and N elements.  Notably, when integrated with the machine-learned DFT model developed in our prior work, the resulting model achieves accuracy closely approaching that of coupled cluster calculations and demonstrably outperforms many conventional DFT methods across diverse reactive systems.

Chemical practitioners are not immune to the appeal of foundation models, nor are they immune to the many risks and harms that these models introduce. In this work, I present the first analysis of foundation models using the combined lens of scientific ethics and chemical professional ethics. I find that general-purpose generative foundation models are in many ways incompatible with the ethical practice of chemistry, though there are fewer ethical problems with chemistry-specific foundation models. My discussion concludes with an examination of how the harm associated with foundation models can be minimized and further poses a set of lingering questions for chemical practitioners and scientific ethicists.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Education; Chemical Education - General; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-06-17T06:28:21.413Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684cc41d3ba0887c332efa7c/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684cc41d3ba0887c332efa73/original/considering-the-ethics-of-large-machine-learning-models-in-the-chemical-sciences.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6wv52,Pushing Charge Equilibration Based Machine Learning Potentials to their Limits,"Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated its potential in atomistic simulations to bridge the gap between accurate first-principles methods and computationally efficient empirical potentials. This is achieved by learning mappings between a system's structure and its physical properties. State-of-the-art models for potential energy surfaces typically represent chemical structures through (semi-)local atomic environments. However, this approach neglects long-range interactions (most notably electrostatics) and non-local phenomena such as charge transfer, leading to significant errors in the description of molecules or materials in polar anisotropic environments. To address these challenges, ML frameworks that predict self-consistent charge distributions in atomistic systems using the Charge Equilibration (QEq) method are currently popular. In this approach, atomic charges are derived from an electrostatic energy expression that incorporates environment-dependent atomic electronegativities. Herein, we explore the limits of this concept at the example of the previously reported Kernel Charge Equilibration (kQEq) approach, combined with local short-ranged potentials. To this end we consider prototypical systems with varying total charge states and applied electric fields. We find that charge equilibration based models perform well in most situations. However, we also find that some pathologies of conventional QEq carry over to the ML variants in the form of spurious charge transfer and overpolarization in the presence of static electric fields. This indicates a need for new methodological developments.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning,2025-06-21T11:30:59.287Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6852560fc1cb1ecda09cec43/original/pushing-charge-equilibration-based-machine-learning-potentials-to-their-limits.pdf

Hubbard corrected density functional theory (DFT+U) in a numerical atom-centred orbital framework, has been shown to address this challenge but is susceptible to numerical instability when simulating common transition metal oxides (TMOs) e.g., TiO2, and rare-earth metal oxides (REOs) e.g., CeO2, necessitating the development of advanced DFT+U parameterisation strategies. In this work, the numerical instabilities of DFT+U are traced to the default atomic Hubbard projector, which we refine for Ti 3d orbitals in TiO2 using Bayesian optimisation, with a cost function and constraints defined using symbolic regression (SR) and support vector machines, respectively. The optimised Ti 3d Hubbard projector enables the numerically stable simulation of electron polarons at intrinsic and extrinsic defects in both anatase and rutile TiO2, with comparable accuracy to hybrid-DFT at several orders of magnitude lower computational cost. We extend the method by defining a general first-principles approach for optimising Hubbard projectors, based on reproducing orbital occupancies calculated using hybrid-DFT. Using a hierarchical SR-defined cost function that depends on DFT-predicted orbital occupancies, basis set parameters and atomic material descriptors, a generalised workflow for the one-shot computation of Hubbard U values and projectors is presented. The method transferability is shown for 10 prototypical TMOs and REOs, with demonstrable accuracy for unseen materials, that extends to complex battery cathode materials like LiCo(1-x)Mg(x)O(2-x).

Most ML/MM simulations reported to date employ mechanical embedding schemes, and rely on Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potentials to model intermolecular interactions between the ML and MM regions. A promising approach to improving ML/MM schemes is to use electrostatic embedding, where polarization effects on the ML region by the MM region are explicitly incorporated. The electrostatic machine learning embedding (EMLE) method has been developed for this purpose.  Here, we compute absolute hydration free energies for a set of small organic molecules to derive robust methodologies for training EMLE models using quantum mechanical data. We establish protocols for fine-tuning the static and induced components of electrostatic interactions and evaluate the accuracy limits of fitting these components to first-principles calculations. We also introduce an empirical adjustment to enhance agreement with experimental results, strengthening the competitiveness of ML/MM simulations relative to state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we investigate the conformational landscape of macrocyclic compounds using a machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) based on a Nequip-like graph neural network. This MLIP is trained on the energy differences between ωB97XD3 and GFN1-xTB. The model not only reproduces the DFT relative conformer energies of the macrocycles with high fidelity but also yields optimized structures that are practically identical to those obtained via density functional theory.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bzf4z,Hydration Free Energies for Small Molecules with Physics-based Descriptors: Graph Neural Network with Cross Attention,"Hydration free energy (HFE) is a fundamental thermodynamic property with broad relevance in both chemistry and biology, particularly in solvation processes. Traditional methods for computing HFE, such as molecular dynamics simulations, are often computationally intensive and require significant domain-specific calibration. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have enabled more efficient HFE predictions, especially for small molecules. However, many existing ML models lack interpretability and often rely on large, opaque feature sets. In this study, a cross-attention-based graph neural network (GNN) is used for predicting the HFE of small molecules from the FreeSolv dataset. Our model integrates graph representations of solute and solvent molecules and captures their mutual interactions through a cross-attention mechanism during message passing. To enhance physical interpretability, we incorporate a compact set of six global molecular descriptors: approximate electrostatic energy computed via a closed-form Generalized Born (GB) model, polar surface area, logarithm of the octanol–water partition coefficient (log P), hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond acceptors, and the number of rotatable bonds. We benchmark our model against classical machine learning methods and recent GNN-based baselines. Our attention-based GNN not only improves prediction accuracy but also maintains transparency in feature importance. Our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.54 ± 0.04 kcal/mol and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.75 ± 0.03 kcal/mol, which is approximately 23% and 36% improvement as compared to the bestperforming baseline, respectively. The ablation study reveals that among the global descriptors used for the solute, electrostatic energy and polar surface area are the most critical in reducing prediction error, followed by features related to hydrogen bonding.

A powerful tool available for studying their transformations is Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy, where changes in the FTIR absorption bands relate to specific changes in flavin’s bonding or interactions with its neighboring environment. While the infrared (IR) spectra of oxidized flavins are well-characterized, fewer computational and experimental studies have focused on characterizing the IR spectra of flavins in their reduced (radical semiquinone or hydroquinone) states. Here, we employ hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) models with implicit solvation to compute vibrational frequencies and IR intensities for a model flavin (lumiflavin) in its oxidized, anionic semiquinone, anionic hydroquinone, and neutral hydroquinone states. The water solvent configurations around the flavin are sampled with molecular dynamics for each state. These simulations, applied with semi-empirically determined broadening and frequency-scaling factors, are used to assign the main features of experimental FTIR difference spectra in the diagnostic 1350–1750 cm−1 range from a variety of sources. The calculations show distinct, redox-state-dependent frequency shifts, especially for C=O stretching bands and C=N stretching bands consistent with changing formal bond orders in flavin’s pteridine rings upon reduction.

The approximate nature of DFTB makes its reliability highly dependent on parameter quality though. While recent advancements have significantly improved the parametrization of the so-called repulsive potential, the parametrization of the electronic part of the DFTB interaction remains relatively simplistic and underdeveloped. We present our in-house DFTB Slater-Koster Optimizer (DSKO), a novel framework that aims at producing accurate and transferable electronic parameter sets under rigorous physical constraints. Incorporating robust optimization algorithms and physics-informed loss functions, DSKO generates DFTB electronic parameters that yield electronic properties, such as density of states and band structures, closely matching DFT reference data. The versatility of DSKO facilitates the wide application of DFTB to materials science challenges, paving the way for routine high-fidelity semiempirical simulations.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-06-20T08:21:21.059Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68515ead3ba0887c330317a3/original/dsko-dancing-through-dftb-parameterization.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jzqqb,Enabling Next Generation Enzyme Mimics Through Local Electric Field Control in Organic Cage Catalysts,"Electric fields (EFs) can, in principle, accelerate chemical reactions by preferentially stabilizing charge distribution in transition states. In practice, solution-phase molecular tumbling makes alignment of external (applied) EFs with a dipo-lar catalyst challenging, limiting application of EFs in catalyst design. Enzymes impose local oriented EFs on constrained substrates to obtain enormous catalytic accelerations (10^19), but interrogation of EFs in such complex systems remains difficult. Supramolecular enzyme mimics offer a compact, tuneable solution to studying and exploiting oriented EFs in cavities, as long as catalysis is well-oriented. Here, we show that a recently prepared organic cage enzyme mimic is an ideal scaffold for understanding EF-promoted catalysis due to a precisely aligned covalent intermediate. Using theory, we (i) establish the applied field axis that accelerates the rate of an acyl transfer reaction inside the cage; (ii) demonstrate a significant 71% of the applied EF is translated to a reduction in the reaction barrier; (iii) show strategic placement of charged substituents on the cage exterior creates local EFs that accelerate catalysis through-space, overcoming the prob-lem of molecular tumbling; (iv) identify modified catalyst candidates with cavity field strengths comparable to enzyme active sites (~0.2 V/Å) and a predicted 10^2 rate enhancement over the parent cage, representing a 40-50% field conver-sion. Finally, we derive a generalizable finite capacitor model to predict how local, oriented EFs can accelerate catalysis in dipolar fields.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Theory - Computational; Organocatalysis,2025-06-19T09:53:43.335Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68505df61a8f9bdab5de441c/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685059693ba0887c33e42d37/original/enabling-next-generation-enzyme-mimics-through-local-electric-field-control-in-organic-cage-catalysts.pdf

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jdfq2,Understanding DFT uncertainties for more reliable reactivity predictions by advancing the analysis of error sources,"Decades of advancements and thousands of successful applications contributed to the reliability of density functional theory (DFT) methods. Especially in main group chemistry, DFT predictions tend to be increasingly more predictive. In this study we deeply analyze unexpected (ca. 8–13 kcal/mol) DFT disagreements obtained for a few organic reactions using only widely adopted, modern, hybrid and higher rung DFT methods. To understand the underlying causes, here, we move beyond conventional statistics-based benchmarks by combining recent advances in DFT error decomposition with affordable gold-standard references. This approach helps to characterize and disentangle multiple functional and density-based error types and enables us to find functional(s) suitable for broad mechanistic studies in all studied examples. The proposed tools are cost-efficient, readily accessible, and easy to integrate into routine thermochemistry workflows. While the focus is on main group reactions, the approach is applicable also for transition metal, bio-, and surface chemistry to assist more predictive reactivity modeling.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Organocatalysis,2025-06-18T08:18:54.606Z,"[{'title': 'Additional DFT and CCSD(T) results, extended DFT analysis', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684ea4003ba0887c33893a62/original/additional-dft-and-ccsd-t-results-extended-dft-analysis.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684ea191c1cb1ecda00376de/original/understanding-dft-uncertainties-for-more-reliable-reactivity-predictions-by-advancing-the-analysis-of-error-sources.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-dbng4,Resolving molecular interactions in protein folding trajectories with NCIPLOT,"Non-covalent interactions (NCIs) are fundamental to the structure, stability, and function of proteins. These interactions form complex networks that control how different protein regions relate to each other or to external molecules (e.g., solvent, ligands, cofactors, other proteins), shaping the energy landscape of the system.  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to study proteins and other biomolecules, helping to explore their structures and transitions between them at atomic resolution. However, the analysis of MD trajectories is often limited to the estimation of geometric features or metrics relating instantaneous configurations to reference structures, which may overlook relevant details of the interactions that drive conformational changes. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to the analysis of simulation data based on NCIs. This enables a direct, data-driven view of how specific interactions contribute to the stability and rearrangement of structural elements. By applying NCIPLOT4 to MD trajectories, we capture electron density features from topologically meaningful regions to quantify the strength and character of inter-residue interactions across time. This allows us to map the interactions shaping protein conformations and how they change along certain processes.  We apply this framework to ultra-long equilibrium trajectories of protein folding, revealing patterns of interaction changes that correspond to distinct folding pathways.  This NCI-based approach provides a powerful complement to the traditional structural analysis toolbox, deepening our understanding of protein folding dynamics.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-06-16T11:54:31.630Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information for Resolving molecular interactions in protein folding trajectories with NCIPLOT', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684bfd8c3ba0887c330b3aab/original/supporting-information-for-resolving-molecular-interactions-in-protein-folding-trajectories-with-nciplot.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68497eda3ba0887c3392a146/original/resolving-molecular-interactions-in-protein-folding-trajectories-with-nciplot.pdf
