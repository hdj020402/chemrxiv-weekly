10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hgdnn,AI-Assisted Identification and Validation of Non-Covalent Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (Mpro) via Generative Design and Physics-Based Simulations,"The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) underscored the urgent need for effective antiviral therapies. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) remains a critical target due to its essential role in cleaving replicase polyproteins into functional non-structural proteins required for viral replication. Its unique substrate specificity, evolutionary conservation among coronaviruses, and evolutionary divergence from human cysteine proteases make it a high-priority antiviral target. Here, we describe an integrated in silico platform, MedGraphTM, combining AI-based generative modeling, structure-guided docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to identify potential non-covalent Mpro inhibitors. Five de novo ligands were prioritized using a GPU-accelerated docking protocol into the substrate-binding cleft of Mpro (PDB: 7RFW), focusing on engagement with the catalytic dyad (Cys145-His41), followed by machine learning–aided multiparameter optimization and 100 ns MD simulations for dynamic assessment. To evaluate chemical novelty, the CHEESE tool was employed for Morgan fingerprint-based and electrostatics-based similarity analyses against Enamine and ZINC15 libraries, confirming the uniqueness of the prioritized scaffolds.Benchmarking against the COVID Moonshot dataset further confirmed low scaffold overlap, with maximum Tanimoto similarity values ≤0.35, highlighting exploration of underrepresented regions of chemical space. The resulting candidates therefore combine pharmacophoric anchoring with scaffold novelty, providing both therapeutic promise and intellectual property differentiation. Independently, identified hits demonstrated strong and stable binding, favorable thermodynamic profiles, and complementarity with conserved Mpro residues. The distinct chemotypes observed suggest synthetic novelty and potential tractability. This study demonstrates the utility of MedGraph™ in coupling AI-based generative modeling with physics-driven simulations to accelerate antiviral discovery and providing a generalizable framework for the iterative optimization of structurally diverse and pharmacologically tractable inhibitors.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-11-26T07:26:47.838Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69203015a10c9f5ca1fc3235/original/ai-assisted-identification-and-validation-of-non-covalent-inhibitors-of-sars-co-v-2-main-protease-mpro-via-generative-design-and-physics-based-simulations.pdf

Despite its therapeutic promise, TIMP2 has long been considered 'undruggable' due to its cryptic surface topology and lack of canonical active sites. We present a comprehensive computational pipeline integrating CNS-filtered virtual screening, orthogonal ADMET/toxicity validation, and allosteric site targeting to identify small-molecule modulators of TIMP2. Screening ~600,000 CNS-filtered compounds from ZINC20 against a cryptic N-terminal allosteric site (Val6, Leu100, Phe103) identified 178 compounds with favorable drug-like properties. Orthogonal validation using ProTox-III refined this to 154 highest-confidence candidates (Tier 1A) validated across multiple computational toxicology platforms. Site selectivity analysis revealed 99.5% preference for the primary allosteric pocket, establishing it as the dominant binding site for therapeutic intervention. Chemical diversity analysis identified 15 distinct scaffold families spanning both halogenated (26.6%) and non-halogenated (73.4%) chemotypes, demonstrating multiple viable strategies for achieving CNS penetration with clean safety profiles. Our findings challenge the notion of TIMP2 as an undruggable protein and provide 154 experimentally-ready chemical starting points for therapeutic development targeting neuroplasticity and cognitive enhancement.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-11-26T06:40:14.208Z,"[{'title': 'Supplemental Materials', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69201766ef936fb4a2d76405/original/supplemental-materials.zip'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69201766ef936fb4a2d763fc/original/large-scale-virtual-screening-identifies-novel-allosteric-modulators-of-timp2-a-computational-approach-to-enhancing-neuroplasticity.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kcds4,Can machine learning predict the space group preference of organic molecules?,"Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is a valuable computational technique used to anticipate the likely crystal structures of a compound of interest. These methods have been proven useful in research and development of pharmaceutical solid forms and in guiding the discovery of materials with targeted properties. Despite success of CSP in these areas, its widespread application remains limited by computational cost. One approach to reduce the computational cost of CSP is to limit the search space of generated crystal structures; it is common practice to limit the search to a selection of the most frequently-observed space groups, with the associated risk of excluding the space group of an observed crystal structure. As an attempt to reduce computational cost and ambiguity when choosing a set of space groups for CSP, we investigate the use of machine learning models to predict the most likely space group(s) of a given organic molecule. We find that both random forests and graph neural networks provide accuracies far above random, and better than what is achieved by selecting based on the overall space group frequencies observed for organic molecular crystals. The best model, using a graph neural network, achieves a maximum accuracy of 47.2% for single (top-1) space group prediction, which is an improvement of 8.2% above the reference. This model was trained with 3-dimensional molecular information, which improved accuracies compared to a model trained with only 2-dimensional bonding information. Furthermore, we found that random forest models performed best when both chemical and geometric molecular features are included in training, which indicates that both are important in defining a molecule’s preferred space groups.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Materials Chemistry,2025-11-25T14:09:39.129Z,"[{'title': 'supplementary information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691f236965a54c2d4ab41efa/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691e10b5ef936fb4a272f0d9/original/can-machine-learning-predict-the-space-group-preference-of-organic-molecules.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-db0m9,Controllable Molecular Generation with Fine-tuned Flow-matching Model,"Three-dimensional molecular generative models have emerged that produce de novo molecules both unconditionally and conditionally, e.g., within protein pockets. However, steering those models in a specific region of the chemical space that satisfies a set of desired properties remains challenging. In this study, we introduce a flexible reinforcement learning method for flow-matching based generative models, allowing the velocity field to be refined according to a user-defined reward function. In contrast to a pure conditional generation setup, where the set of conditions must be decided a priori, this framework allows fine-tuning of any unconditional or conditional model, reflecting a more realistic scenario where the target properties to be optimized often vary and are typically case-specific. This also enables joint optimization of continuous and discrete features in flow-matching models for the first time. Through extensive experiments across diverse optimization scenarios, we demonstrate that models trained with this strategy (agents) consistently outperform baseline approaches (priors) when evaluated against the target design criteria.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-11-25T12:45:09.922Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691f2d1cef936fb4a2ad9381/original/controllable-molecular-generation-with-fine-tuned-flow-matching-model.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rs07k,Autonomous Universal Research Assistant (AURA): Agentic AI meets nanoHUB's FAIR Workflows and Data,"Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to redefine how science is conducted, automating not just data analysis but the entire research lifecycle, from hypothesis generation to validation. Yet most current AI agents remain domain-bound, tailored to specific applications such as materials synthesis or quantum chemistry, limiting their applicability and impact. We introduce AURA, a multi-agent, autonomous research assistant that integrates a large language model (LLM) with nanoHUB's open scientific ecosystem, encompassing over 340 FAIR-compliant simulation tools and 1.6 million data points contributed by its users. Unlike prior systems, AURA dynamically discovers and orchestrates simulations and data through runtime metadata reasoning, enabling seamless execution of research plans that span multiple disciplines. As nanoHUB expands, AURA automatically integrates newly published simulation tools and associated datasets, learning their services and requirements from their metadata. Through case studies in protein folding, high-pressure materials properties, and the prediction of melting temperatures of high-entropy alloys, we demonstrate AURA's capacity for scientific ideation and planning, adaptive workflow composition, and autonomous execution. Since simulation results are automatically stored for every simulation executed in nanoHUB, AURA naturally learns from prior work, including negative results, to optimize simulation setups. AURA reproduced a recently published result in minutes, a 10x speedup over advanced users with computational and domain expertise. AURA marks a step toward general-purpose, scalable, and expandable AI research assistants capable of accelerating discovery in the physical and life sciences.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-11-25T09:59:52.325Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691e4b62ef936fb4a28038d7/original/autonomous-universal-research-assistant-aura-agentic-ai-meets-nano-hub-s-fair-workflows-and-data.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q,Augmenting Large Language Models for Automated Discovery of f-Element Extractants,"Efficient separation of f-elements is a critical challenge for a wide range of emerging technologies. The chemical similarity among these elements makes the development of selective solvent extraction reagents both slow and difficult. Here, we present a quasi-autonomous, AI-enabled workflow for the design and computational screening of selective extractant ligands. Molecular design is guided by SAFE-MolGen, a large language model-based agentic system that leverages curated extraction data to propose new ligands and preliminarily rank their performance using a supervised machine learning model trained on experimental datasets to consider the impact of realistic experimental conditions. Promising human-approved ligands are then passed to a second automated pipeline that constructs three-dimensional metal-ligand complexes and performs quantum mechanical free energy calculations to directly assess metal selectivity. We demonstrate this approach for Am(III)/Eu(III) separations and report several newly designed ligands predicted to exhibit higher Am(III)/Eu(III) selectivity than the benchmark extractant CyMe4BTBP. This workflow accelerates computational exploration of the molecular space in this data-sparse field and provides a general strategy for the rapid generation and evaluation of novel lanthanide (Ln) and actinide (An) extractants.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xn2mp-v2,Practical integration of machine learning into ab initio calculations and workflows: Accelerating the SCF cycle via density matrix predictions,"Data-driven approaches offer great potential for accelerating ab initio electronic structure calculations of molecules and materials but their transferability is often limited due to the vast amount of data needed for training, including when addressing the need to fine-tune universal models for each specific system to be studied. Here, we demonstrate how contributions from system-specific electronic structure machine learning (ESML) models may be combined (“stitched”) to deliver density matrices of entire systems of interest, improving the initial guess for the self-consistent field cycle and delivering gains in computational efficiency. The “stitching” of density matrices is demonstrated for sequential calculations, such as geometry optimization and molecular dynamics, and we show that the synergistic use of ESML models and density matrix extrapolation algorithms can accelerate standard computational calculations. The algorithms are demonstrated for test cases relating to water clusters and a methane clathrate cage, with the benefits discussed. The future opportunities for hybrid quantum mechanical and ML (QM/ML), and also ML/ML paradigms, are broad-ranging with significant computational speed-up attainable.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning,2025-11-30T03:51:31.848Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6924603ba10c9f5ca187461d/original/practical-integration-of-machine-learning-into-ab-initio-calculations-and-workflows-accelerating-the-scf-cycle-via-density-matrix-predictions.pdf

Our approach integrates an efficient sampling of environmental configurations with a hierarchical model that predicts forces and dipole moments as analytical derivatives of the energy, allowing IR spectra simulations from MD trajectories. Solvent effects are incorporated through a molecular mechanics (MM) representation of the environment embedded within the ML description of the solute. Applied to representative bio-related systems, the resulting ML/MM framework reproduces experimental spectra with high fidelity and accurately captures solvent-driven vibrational shifts. This approach provides a computationally efficient and robust route for describing solvent effects in vibrational spectroscopy.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.),2025-11-28T13:12:57.372Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69257b0065a54c2d4a90d3a7/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6925723da10c9f5ca1a4d24e/original/multiscale-machine-learning-prediction-of-infrared-spectra-of-solvated-molecules.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-68g6s-v2,Machine Learning Accelerated Path Integral Molecular Dynamics and 13C NMR Simulations Unlock New Insights Into Quantum Effects in C60 Fullerene,"A definitive answer on the existence and magnitude of the negative thermal expansion (NTE) and the 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signature in C60 fullerene has been previously demonstrated using quantum-mechanical treatments of thermal rovibrational motion. This approach, while accurate, is computationally expensive, lacks the implementation of dispersion corrections, and is fundamentally limited to systems with well-defined equilibrium geometries and sufficiently strong restoring forces, making it inapplicable to weakly bound van der Waals complexes. Alternative methods, such as ab initio path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD), are more flexible but remain computationally expensive, especially when combined with calculations of 13C NMR parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an accurate and efficient neural network-based approach that combines machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with an NMR machine learning (NMR-ML) model. MLIPs enable machine learning PIMD (MLPIMD) simulations, while the NMR-ML model computes 13C isotropic magnetic shielding, σiso, directly from MLPIMD snapshots. We perform temperature-dependent MLPIMD simulations with MLIPs trained at different levels of theory. In all cases, NTE is observed, and the results reveal how both dispersion effects and atomic basis set choices influence its magnitude. Furthermore, we confirm that NTE is a quantum-mechanical phenomenon and, hence, classical MD simulations cannot reproduce it. To further test our approach, we investigate fully quantum-mechanical secondary isotope shifts of 13C NMR magnetic shielding due to the isotope change from 12C to 13C of the immediate neighbor with hexagon-hexagon or hexagon-pentagon bond with the observed nucleus. The results show a good agreement with the experimental data, highlighting the accuracy of our approach. This work demonstrates that ML-accelerated simulations enable accurate and efficient modeling of thermally activated quantum mechanical phenomena.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Carbon-based Materials; Machine Learning; Quantum Mechanics,2025-11-28T12:40:31.716Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information for ""Machine Learning-Accelerated Path Integral Molecular Dynamics and 13C NMR Simulations Unlock New Insights Into Quantum Effects in C60 Fullerene""', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69254e3965a54c2d4a8c72e9/original/supplementary-information-for-machine-learning-accelerated-path-integral-molecular-dynamics-and-13c-nmr-simulations-unlock-new-insights-into-quantum-effects-in-c60-fullerene.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69254e3965a54c2d4a8c72dc/original/machine-learning-accelerated-path-integral-molecular-dynamics-and-13c-nmr-simulations-unlock-new-insights-into-quantum-effects-in-c60-fullerene.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-d423c,Impact of surface vacancies on the dynamics of metal atoms on reducible oxides: An enhanced sampling study with machine-learned potentials for Pt1/TiO2,"Surface vacancies play an important role in the chemistry of reducible oxides such as TiO2. It has been shown through experiments and quantum chemistry calculations that surface vacancies can trap precious metal atoms more effectively than pristine surfaces. In this study, we perform nanosecond timescale molecular dynamics (MD) and metadynamics simulations at 1000 K to probe the evolution of platinum metal atoms adsorbed at or adjacent to cationic and anionic surface vacancies on rutile titania (110). To this end, we employ machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) that are iteratively trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. MD simulations show that Pt atom motion is subdiffusive across both anionic and cationic vacancies, indicating that these sites are thermally stable. Near-linear O-Pt-O motifs, found in earlier studies to be stable on the pristine surface of TiO2 are no longer stable in the vicinity of a vacancy. We utilize well-tempered, multiple walker metadynamics to map the free energy landscape of Pt migration out of the vacancy sites. The free energy barriers to Pt migration are highest for the cationic vacancy, followed by bridging oxygen and basal oxygen vacancies. The fact that Pt at the cationic vacancy site is most stable is encouraging because it has also been shown to be one of the most active sites for reactions such as CO oxidation.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry,2025-11-28T09:52:34.907Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6924bc30ef936fb4a26ea9be/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6924b8c065a54c2d4a7ace91/original/impact-of-surface-vacancies-on-the-dynamics-of-metal-atoms-on-reducible-oxides-an-enhanced-sampling-study-with-machine-learned-potentials-for-pt1-ti-o2.pdf

However, predicting prodrug activation remains challenging, causing design failures and limiting systematic exploration of the prodrug design space. Here, we developed an ensemble Siamese neural network model to predict prodrug activation. We demonstrate that our model accurately predicts 95% of all approved prodrugs, compared to less than 75% for any of the currently established metabolism models. Prospective validation on in-house designed prodrugs further confirmed the model’s ability to rank prodrug candidates by their observed release profiles.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mrgzj-v2,Mixture-of-Experts Transformers for Faithfully Deorbitalized Meta-GGA Density Functionals,"Meta-GGA density functional theory (DFT) is an important method in ab initio materials modelling; however, its computational cost limits applicability for generating large datasets or simulating extended length and time scales, as necessary for modern materials discovery. Deorbitalization is a promising strategy to accelerate meta-GGA DFT by removing the explicit orbital dependence of the exchange-correlation energy and potential using an approximation for the non-local kinetic energy density. Currently, achieving both accuracy and stability in practical deorbitalized simulations remains challenging, as many popular exchange-correlation density functionals are rigidly structured and inherently resistant to deorbitalization. These challenges motivate the need to understand the adaptability of traditional density functionals and to develop more advanced strategies for their design. Guided by this understanding, we adopt a physics-informed deep learning approach to reparameterize popular semi-local meta-GGA density functionals into non-local deorbitalized surrogates that more faithfully mimic their orbital-dependent parent functionals. Our approach is investigated for the deorbitalization of the MS2 exchange density functional of Sun et al. [DOI: 10.1063/1.4789414] using a transformer encoder that leverages multi-head self-attention and automatic differentiation to accurately predict exchange energy densities and partial derivatives across real-space integration grids. The outcome is a deep learning-based procedure for deorbitalizing meta-GGA density functionals that generalizes across diverse chemical bonding environments in both molecules and materials using a sparse mixture-of-experts model. The work shows the potential of advanced deep learning architectures towards constructing accurate surrogate models of expensive electronic structure methods, whilst outlining a path towards robust deorbitalized simulations of molecules and solids.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning,2025-11-26T13:38:26.434Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6921e67ba10c9f5ca1397af2/original/mixture-of-experts-transformers-for-faithfully-deorbitalized-meta-gga-density-functionals.pdf

In this work, a machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) was developed and iteratively refined to investigate the structural, mechanical, and transport properties of lithium thiophosphate (LPS) electrolytes. The model was trained on over 15,000 DFT-calculated structures using the aenet-PyTorch framework and subsequently employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to probe pressure-dependent lithium-ion conductivity and mechanical response. Stress-strain analysis established a direct connection between local structural motifs and mechanical properties: Li2PS3 exhibits high stiffness (Young's modulus 52.9 GPa) due to dense P-S-P bridging of PS3(2-) chains and P2S7(2-) dimers, whereas Li3PS4 and Li7P3S11 are more compliant (16–17 GPa) because of a higher concentration of PS4(3-) tetrahedra, consistent with radial distribution function analysis. Ionic conductivity, computed via the Nernst-Einstein relation from 2 ns MD simulations across strain and temperature, shows that Li3PS4 exhibits pronounced strain-dependent transport, peaking at 0.55 S/cm at 600 K and 12% strain with a minimum activation energy of 0.11 eV. In contrast, Li7P3S11 displays strain-independent conductivity due to its robust three-dimensional diffusion network, in contrast to the quasi-two-dimensional network of Li3PS4. These results demonstrate the power of MLIPs for resolving the interplay between mechanical behavior and lithium-ion transport and highlight how polyanion chemistry and strain can be leveraged to tune solid-state electrolyte performance.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Energy Storage,2025-11-24T13:21:18.594Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691d26bda10c9f5ca172cb37/original/machine-learning-insights-into-mechanical-and-ionic-transport-processes-in-thiophosphate-solid-electrolytes.pdf

This method enables a rigorous treatment of dispersion on top of electrostatic and induction effects in ground and excited-state calculations. Using QM/MMpol-cLR$^3$, we show that dispersion interactions control excited-state solvatochromism through two distinct mechanisms. In azulene, opposite shifts of the L$_a$ and L$_b$ states arise from state-specific dispersion linked to changes in excited-state polarizability. In bacteriochlorophyll a, dispersion instead stems from the interplay between polarizability changes and transition-dipole–driven response, governing the Q$_y$ and Q$_x$ shifts.

Recent research demonstrates that with carefully designed architectures, ANNs can not only represent ground states of model systems with high precision but also tackle the sign problem, offering a promising path forward for strongly correlated electronic structure calculations.2,3 This review charts the paradigm shift driven by Neural Network Quantum States (NNQS), which leverage the representational power of deep learning to overcome these barriers. We detail the architectural evolution from Restricted Boltzmann Machines to autoregressive models like RNNs and Transformers, which enable exact, uncorrelated sampling and bypass critical
bottlenecks.2,4,5Furthermore, we explore the geometric foundation of high-efficiency optimization via the neural
networks, which decouples optimization cost from model complexity.6 The frontier of the field is marked by the
integration of operator learning and hybrid quantum-classical frameworks, such as Reinforcement Learning for
contracted quantum eigen-solvers and Quantum-Enhanced Neural Networks, which leverage quantum processors to enhance expressivity for hardware-efficient Ansätze.7,8 By framing the problem through the lens of computational resource allocation—specifically, trading exponential memory demands for polynomialcomplexity optimization and sampling—this review elucidates how recent advances at the intersection of artificial neural networks and quantum computing have evolved. The emergence of those methods not merely progress into a powerful simulation-tools, but also a hybrid computational interface.9 This convergence offers a versatile and systematically improvable framework for potentially addressing some of the most challenging

The domain-based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO) approach, which has successfully been applied to lower levels of coupled-cluster theory, is utilized in our algorithm, and thus our algorithm is called DLPNO-CCSDTQ. For simplicity in the working equations and in the implementation, we t1-dress the two-electron integrals as well as Fock matrix elements. Our method can recover CCSDTQ-CCSDT and CCSDTQ-CCSDT(Q) energy differences on the order of 0.01 kcal/mol, even at a loose quadruples natural orbital (QNO) occupation number cutoff of 3.33 * 10^-6.

Two mmDNA structures were considered, using cytosine/thymine mismatches with coordinated Ag and Hg metal atoms. These base pairs were parameterized with the proposed computational framework and subjected to multiple validation steps. The generated force fields showed enhanced structural stability within the metallated base pairs, with the coordinated metal rotating into the major groove. Our findings show a higher propeller angle associated with the metallated base pair, which agrees with previously reported experimental data. The developed force fields have the potential to unveil the structural dynamics of long metallated DNA nanowires, while results have been demonstrated on a chain of three mmDNA base pairs.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-95h3k,Many Roads to the Seam: How Conformational Flexibility Drives Nonadiabatic Relaxation in a Prototypical Tetrapyrrolic Chromophore,"Large and structurally flexible chromophores pose challenges for in silico modelling of photodeactivation due to the many vibrational modes that can funnel the system toward energy degeneracy. In this work, we examine how the multiple degrees of freedom in biliverdin, a prototypical tetrapyrrolic chromophore, cooperate to drive access to the S1/S0 intersection seam in vacuo. We begin by mapping the ground-state potential energy surface to identify representative biliverdin conformers relevant to photoexcitation. We then use a CASSCF-based framework to map the excited-state landscape and characterize the intersection seam, identifying distinct conical-intersection types. Finally, we employ ab initio multiple spawning to resolve the dynamical pathways by which the system accesses these regions. DFT potential-energy and free-energy mappings indicate that, although several conformers are relevant, the “locked-helix” ZsZsZs conformer predominates on the ground state. The intersection seam comprises numerous geometrically distinct regions characterized by varying degrees and combinations of dihedral torsion, pyramidalization, and bond-length alternation. Yet only select regions lie within energetic reach, and moderate barriers separate them from the S1 minimum. Nonadiabatic dynamics combined with multivariate analyses show that, despite extensive mode coupling during deactivation that guides the system toward multiple regions of the seam, a single dihedral torsion together with bond-length alternation predominantly drive energy degeneracy. This work offers new insight into biliverdin’s intrinsic photochemical response and underscores a general feature of flexible chromophores: many modes may participate during photorelaxation, but only a limited subset ultimately dictates seam accessibility.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-11-26T10:48:41.267Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting information for: Many Roads to the Seam: How Conformational Flexibility Drives Nonadiabatic Relaxation in a Prototypical Tetrapyrrolic Chromophore', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6920d031a10c9f5ca11204e8/original/supporting-information-for-many-roads-to-the-seam-how-conformational-flexibility-drives-nonadiabatic-relaxation-in-a-prototypical-tetrapyrrolic-chromophore.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6920cee1a10c9f5ca111435a/original/many-roads-to-the-seam-how-conformational-flexibility-drives-nonadiabatic-relaxation-in-a-prototypical-tetrapyrrolic-chromophore.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jzv5j-v3,Beyond Exactness: Approximation Strategies to the Many-Body Schrödinger Equation for Modern Quantum Chemistry Applications,"The many-body Schrödinger equation is a fundamental framework for describing the behaviors of electrons in
molecular systems based on quantum mechanics. It largely forms the basis for quantum-chemistry-based energy
calculation and has become the core concept of modern electronic structure theory.1 However, its complexity
increases exponentially with the number of interacting particles, and its exact solution remains intractable in
most cases. To bridge this gap, various approximation strategies have been developed, forming the basis of
modern quantum chemistry.1 Accurate approximation methods for the many-body Schrödinger equation enable
the solution of complex, otherwise intractable problems with enhanced accuracy and balanced computational
costs. This review focuses on the conceptual foundations of these approximation approaches, ranging from
mean-field theories, such as Hartree–Fock, through post–Hartree–Fock correlation methods, including
configuration interaction, perturbation theory, and coupled-cluster techniques, to the widely adopted density
functional theory and semi-empirical models; newly emerging methods such as quantum Monte Carlo, and
machine learning-augmented strategies would also be addressed.
2-8 The accuracy and efficiency were also
briefly mentioned for those approximation methods, highlighting the trade-offs between theoretical rigor and
computational feasibility. These approximation strategies for the many-body Schrödinger equation continue to
be central to quantum chemistry, enabling increasingly reliable predictions of molecular structure, energetics,
and dynamics with reduced computational costs.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-m6sft,"Diabatization with electrostatic embedding for studying
photophysics in organic molecular crystals","Highly emissive organic molecular crystals find applications in several areas, such as organic electronics, solar cells, and sensors. Understanding the excited-state mechanisms underlying these applications is essential for optimizing and controlling them effectively. Exciton models coupled with nonadiabatic dynamics, particularly quantum dynamics, provide crucial insights into photochemical and photophysical processes in molecular crystals. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of general tools and automated workflows to facilitate such simulations. In this paper, we present a computational strategy to investigate the photoactivated dynamics of organic molecular crystals, bridging methodologies traditionally used for molecular systems and materials science, with a particular focus on the interplay between local excitations and charge-transfer (CT) processes. We have implemented an interface between the fromage and Overdia programs, enabling the construction of vibronic Hamiltonians for molecular crystals within an excited-state ONIOM(QM:QM’) framework, incorporating long-range electrostatics through a RESP-based Ewald summation. Fragment-based diabatization provides a route to quantum dynamics simulations in weak-to-intermediate coupling regimes. The method was applied to the photophysics of dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) crystals using time-dependent DFT. The fromage/Overdia interface was employed to compute the couplings of local excitations and CT states for all 18 unique DBC dimers in the crystal and to quantify the influence of electrostatic embedding, which was found to be modest (10–20%). Simulations on π-stacked dimers reproduced the small red shift observed experimentally from solution to crystal, attributed to electronic interactions among fixed monomers rather than crystal electrostatics. Quantum dynamics simulations revealed ultrafast population transfer from bright local excitations to charge-transfer states. This approach establishes a robust framework linking molecular and solid-state excited-state dynamics, with potential applications for studying excitations, defects, and impurities in molecular crystals.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry,2025-11-25T08:12:20.729Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information ', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691ddb6bef936fb4a26a4e12/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691dd0d165a54c2d4a753627/original/diabatization-with-electrostatic-embedding-for-studying-photophysics-in-organic-molecular-crystals.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6k0zs,Which molecular fragmentation scheme is best suited for   relative energies of proteins?,"Conventional quantum chemical (QC) methods exhibit a steep computational scaling with respect to the number of atoms in the investigated system.  Hence, working with larger systems like peptides or even proteins becomes computationally unfeasible with traditional QC methods. One way to overcome this challenge are molecular fragmentation methods. Many different flavours of molecular fragmentation schemes based on different partitionings have been suggested in the literature, but have hardly been compared numerically. Our group has recently reported a common formalism for molecular fragmentation schemes, which enables a consistent benchmark of different approaches. Here, we assess the performance of the molecular fractionation with hydrogen caps (MFHC), the pair-pair approximation to the generalized many-body expansion (pp-GMBE), and the molecules-in-molecules (MIM) approach within this general framework. Our benchmark includes single- and multi-level schemes as well as an electrostatic embedding of the fragments in point charges of the whole system. The energies and computational demand of a chosen set of proteins are evaluated with the different methods within the framework. This enables a rare numerical comparison between the different schemes. Of the compared methods, our implementation of pp-GMBE yields the best agreement with experiment, while MFHC with additional pair couplings offers a good cost-accuracy ratio.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-11-25T07:29:20.327Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information to: Which molecular fragmentation scheme is best suited for relative energies of proteins?', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691dc489a10c9f5ca18a4668/original/supporting-information-to-which-molecular-fragmentation-scheme-is-best-suited-for-relative-energies-of-proteins.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691db8c2ef936fb4a265a6aa/original/which-molecular-fragmentation-scheme-is-best-suited-for-relative-energies-of-proteins.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3jqnp,Understanding the photochemistry of a crystalline push-pull norbornadiene photoswitch,"Molecular solar thermal (MOST) materials store and release solar energy through light-induced reversible reactions involving molecular photoswitches. Solid-state crystalline MOST materials can offer higher energy densities and easier device integration than their liquid counterparts. However, their photochemical mechanisms remain poorly understood. Norbornadiene (NBD), which undergoes a [2+2]-photocycloaddition to form its photoisomer quadricyclane (QC), has been proposed as a candidate for MOST applications. We used multiconfigurational quantum mechanical calculations and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics to investigate the mechanism of a push–pull NBD-derivative, 1,3,4-trimethyl-5,6-dicyanonorbornadiene (TMDCNBD). This study demonstrates cutting-edge multiscale ONIOM(QM/QM′) nonadiabatic molecular dynamics framework in TMDCNBD crystals. The crystal packing of TMDCNBD preserves molecular flexibility, enabling ultrafast [2+2]-photocycloaddition via energetically accessible S₁/S₀ conical intersections, with negligible exciton transport. Simulations predict product quantum yields of 57% for TMDCNBD and 37% for its metastable quadricyclane (QC) form, TMDCQC, which stores 0.36 MJ kg⁻¹. This work demonstrates TMDCNBD as a promising crystalline MOST candidate and establishes a transferable computational protocol for modelling ultrafast photochemistry in the solid state.
