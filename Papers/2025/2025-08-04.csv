10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kxg13,AI-Driven Electrocatalysis: Adaptive Control of the Glycerol Oxidation Reaction via Reinforcement Learning,"In recent years, artificial intelligence (A) has entered the field of electrocatalysis as a tool to accelerate electrocatalyst discovery and optimization. Here, we present the full development process of a reinforcement learning-based AI-controller deployed in a closed-loop experimental setup to optimize the glycerol oxidation reaction. The controller autonomously discovered a non-periodic pulsing strategy that adaptively alternates between active and recovery phases. Analysis of the policy and generated data suggests the presence of three distinct deactivation mechanisms: a fast reversible process mitigated by oxidative pulses; a slower reversible process alleviated through near open circuit potential relaxation; and a third, irreversible process leading to permanent deactivation. To support the AI-controller’s development, a data-driven digital twin based on a recurrent neural network, was trained on the experimental data. This digital twin enabled rapid hypothesis testing by simulating the response to user-defined pulsing protocols. Together, this work demonstrates that AI can not only be used to automate experimental design and execution but also to provide mechanistic insights, making AI-driven electrocatalytic research more accessible.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Artificial Intelligence; Electrocatalysis,2025-08-01T10:33:40.790Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688a5107fc5f0acb52e89417/original/ai-driven-electrocatalysis-adaptive-control-of-the-glycerol-oxidation-reaction-via-reinforcement-learning.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-5fcj6,An exploration of dataset bias in single-step retrosynthesis prediction,"Single-step retrosynthesis models are integral to the development of computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) tools, leveraging past reaction data to generate new synthetic pathways. However, it remains unclear how the diversity of reactions within a training set impacts model performance. Here, we assess how dataset size and diversity, as defined using automatically extracted reaction templates, affect accuracy and reaction feasibility of three state-of-the-art architectures – template-based LocalRetro and template-free MEGAN and RootAligned.  We show that increasing the diversity of the training set (from 1k to 10k templates) significantly increases top-5 round-trip accuracy while reducing top-10 accuracy, impacting prediction feasibility and recall, respectively. In contrast, increasing dataset size without increasing template diversity yields minimal performance gains for LocalRetro and MEGAN, showing that these architectures are robust even with smaller datasets. Moreover, reaction templates that are less common in the training dataset have significantly lower top-k accuracy than more common ones, regardless of the model architecture. Finally, we use an external data source to validate the drastic difference between top-k accuracies on seen and unseen templates, showing that there is limited capability for generalisation to novel disconnections. Our findings suggest that reaction templates can be used to describe the underlying diversity of reaction datasets and the scope of trained models, and that the task of single-step retrosynthesis suffers from a class imbalance problem.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-07-31T05:53:23.920Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6888a02dfc5f0acb529e6496/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6865bb52c1cb1ecda0c4e841/original/an-exploration-of-dataset-bias-in-single-step-retrosynthesis-prediction.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-4pk4w,Semantically-Linked Ontological Knowledge Extraction Graph For Domain-Specific Knowledge Discovery In Scientific Literature,"The rapid growth of scientific papers presents several challenges for researchers, including information
overload, data fragmentation, lack of standard terminology, and limited interoperability. These
issues make it increasingly difficult to keep up with the literature and extract useful, field-specific
information efficiently. To address these challenges, we introduce the semantically-linked ontological
knowledge extraction framework, a tool that combines smart linking of concepts, flexible ontology
building, and graph-based reasoning to organize and extract knowledge. This semantically-linked
ontological knowledge extraction graph (SOKE Graph) leverages large-language models to extract
domain-specific concepts from scientific articles, ensuring both semantic accuracy and adaptability to
new data. These concepts are organized using an ontology—a structured framework of terms and
relationships—that supports systematic data collection by grouping information into clearly defined
layers. The resulting knowledge graph enables structured representation of extracted domain-specific
information, allowing researchers to explore relationships between concepts and efficiently retrieve
relevant data aligned with the objectives of this work. This approach allows SOKE Graph to find the
connections between concepts and publications, and retrieve the most relevant studies in response
to user questions. Initial evaluations of SOKE Graph show that it helps improve the accuracy of
filtering high-relevance papers from large datasets compared to using only large-language models,
and generates structured, interpretable outputs that facilitate data-driven insights. Moreover, this
framework provides a robust and scalable artificial intelligence-based tool that accelerates literature
analysis, guides decision-making, and helps researchers efficiently locate relevant information within
complex scientific domains.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Artificial Intelligence; Electrocatalysis,2025-07-30T11:03:53.348Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688787b0728bf9025ea557d0/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68878390fc5f0acb526b51f5/original/semantically-linked-ontological-knowledge-extraction-graph-for-domain-specific-knowledge-discovery-in-scientific-literature.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-qmqdr,Relating model performance to embedding distributions in molecular machine learning,"In molecular machine learning, the choice of the representation of molecules can have a significant impact on model performance. However, understanding the root causes of these performance differences often proves challenging. One promising approach to explore model behavior is representational alignment, which quantifies the similarity between models based on their embedding distributions. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that demonstrates how differences in model performance are fundamentally bounded by their representational alignment. Our theoretical argument predicts the existence of an exclusion zone, a region in the alignment–performance difference space where large performance gaps do not occur if alignment is high. We validate this prediction empirically across a large number of datasets and find that the exclusion zone extends beyond what theory alone would suggest. We also examine model ensembling through the lens of representational alignment. Interestingly, we find no practically meaningful differences between ensembles and individual models in terms of alignment. By grounding empirical observations in theory, our approach offers a principled and interpretable path toward building more effective molecular machine learning systems.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-07-28T13:01:06.903Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6881f394fc5f0acb52bab2f9/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6881f132728bf9025ef53fdf/original/relating-model-performance-to-embedding-distributions-in-molecular-machine-learning.pdf

However, the complexity of NMR spectra can make structural assignments prone to er-rors. Here we introduce a deep learning model – CASCADE-2.0 (ChemicAl Shift CAlculation with DEep learn-ing), a practical tool designed to assist chemists in making fast, reliable, and transparent 13C-NMR chemical shift predictions. Building on our previous model, we make improvements to the model architecture and train-ing data, while striving to enhance the model transparency. Leveraging advances in neural network poten-tials, a fourfold expansion of training data in terms of molecular and elemental coverage is made, resulting in a dataset containing around 170,000 experimental shifts cross-validated by DFT. To address DFT limitations, we developed an intelligent data augmentation strategy combining statistical analysis and machine learning predictions to further expand the dataset to 211,000 experimental values. With the expanded dataset and changes in model architecture, a state-of-the-art accuracy of 0.73 ppm was achieved when compared against experimental 13C-NMR shifts. The model also incorporates prediction confidence metrics using a deep-kernel learning architecture, as well as nearest-neighbor analysis, facilitated by a user-friendly web-server.

However, the diversity of emerging materials and cell architectures presents significant challenges to the generalizability of conventional prognostic approaches. Here, we propose a novel physics-informed battery modeling network (PIBMN) that integrates data-driven learning with physical priors, enabling continuous parameter adaptation and broad applicability across cell formats and chemistries. PIBMN effectively captures both fast and slow dynamic responses under a wide range of load profiles, applicable to both commercial and laboratory-scale cells. By maintaining nonlinear expressivity while ensuring numerical stability, the model yields high-fidelity, interpretable representations of internal electrochemical states. Beyond conventional health prognostics, PIBMN introduces a novel capability to decouple complex electrochemical kinetics and concurrently track terminal voltage in real time, enabling mechanistic diagnostics with high resolution. As such, PIBMN establishes a versatile and scalable framework for in-line quality control, adaptive cell-specific battery management, and data-informed optimization of next-generation battery manufacturing processes.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Analytical Chemistry; Electrochemical Analysis; Machine Learning,2025-07-28T05:19:09.775Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68822973fc5f0acb52c41b0f/original/continuous-physics-informed-learning-expedites-universal-battery-mechanism-decoupling.pdf

In this study, we introduce Fragment-wise Mutual Information (FMI) as a quantum information-based tool to quantify inter-atomic correlations in peptides. By extending mutual information (MI) analysis to amino acid fragments, FMI provides a detailed map of electronic interactions beyond classical descriptors such as van der Waals forces. We first validated FMI on 400 dipeptides, demonstrating a correlation with atomization and bonding energies. Expanding this approach to the 10-mer Neh2 peptide, we analyze molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and reveal how inter-atomic correlations evolve during folding. Our results show that FMI distinguishes stabilizing interactions such as salt bridges and variable hydrogen bond strengths, providing deeper insight into peptide stability. These findings suggest that FMI could enhance molecular modeling and force field development by incorporating quantum electronic effects into biomolecular analysis.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-07-30T09:27:35.294Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68876b8823be8e43d668cda2/original/from-dipeptide-systems-to-polypeptides-evolution-of-mutual-information.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-4prb2,Benchmarking DFT Calculations for Adsorption Studies: Pharmaceuticals and Related Organic Molecules in Cation-exchanged Zeolites,"The choice of exchange-correlation functional and dispersion correction significantly influences the adsorption energies obtained from dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) methods. Several studies have employed different approaches to calculate the adsorption energy of small (and a few large) molecules in all-silica or protonated zeolites, often referencing high-level computational results or experimental data. However, systematic investigations into the adsorption of large pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) contaminants in cation-exchanged zeolites remain limited. This study aims to determine which functional is particularly well-suited for large-scale screening of large PPCPs adsorption in cation-exchanged zeolites. We have studied nine (mono- and divalent) metal cations (including alkali, alkaline earth, and transition metals) and compared eleven dispersion-corrected DFT approaches, including methods based on pairwise dispersion corrections, non-local van der Waals, and Minnesota density functionals. Furthermore, saturated cluster (SC) models are used to calculate DFT energies, which are then compared with the ‘gold standard’ reference values from the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method. For periodic systems, the variation in adsorption energies for host-guest combinations is explained using cationic radii versus adsorption energy trends, with a few exceptions further clarified through charge density mapping, which identifies cases where cation- interactions are present. On the other hand, in SC models, various error statistics, along with the decomposition of total adsorption energies into electronic and dispersion contributions (for DFT), and Hartree Fock and correlation energies (CCSD(T)), are applied to identify the most accurate functional for PPCPs@cation-FAU complexes. Overall calculations and error analysis provide a clear conclusion that the PBEsol-D3 functional can be recommended for the prediction of PPCP adsorption energies in cation-exchanged as well as all-silica zeolites.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Structure; Materials Chemistry,2025-08-01T15:10:14.063Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information PDF', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688798c023be8e43d66ecf61/original/supporting-information-pdf.pdf'}, {'title': 'SI Table of adsorption energies (periodic)', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68879923fc5f0acb526e2274/original/si-table-of-adsorption-energies-periodic.xlsx'}, {'title': 'SII Table of adsorption energies (non-periodic)', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6887995623be8e43d66ee7cf/original/sii-table-of-adsorption-energies-non-periodic.xlsx'}, {'title': 'SIII Results of CCSD(T) calculations', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6887998ffc5f0acb526e31be/original/siii-results-of-ccsd-t-calculations.xlsx'}, {'title': 'SIV Decomposition of adsorption energies', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688799b4fc5f0acb526e3a37/original/siv-decomposition-of-adsorption-energies.xlsx'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68879472fc5f0acb526d8038/original/benchmarking-dft-calculations-for-adsorption-studies-pharmaceuticals-and-related-organic-molecules-in-cation-exchanged-zeolites.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-7t6r0,A Genetic Algorithm Approach for Compact Wave Function Representations in Spin-Adapted Bases,"The accurate treatment of many-unpaired-electron systems remains a central challenge in quantum chemistry, due to the exponential growth of the many-electron wave function with the number of correlated electrons. Quantum Anamorphosis addresses this challenge through physically motivated localization of molecular orbitals and site reordering, which yield unique block-diagonal Hamiltonian matrices and compact spin-adapted many-body wave functions. 
In this work, we introduce a genetic algorithm to identify optimal orbital/site orderings that enhance wave function compactness, thereby enabling the study of larger systems than previously possible. Crucially, we propose fitness functions based on approximate measures of the wave function compactness, which enable inexpensive genetic algorithm searches. We benchmark the strategy against one- and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor Heisenberg models, the one-dimensional next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model, and selected ground and excited states of the nitrogenase P-cluster, employing intermediate CAS(48,40) and large CAS(114,73) active space ab initio Hamiltonians. These results highlight the applicability and scalability of the genetic-algorithm-driven approach for tackling systems with many unpaired electrons.

Our strategy is a bidirectional two-state approach that simultaneously drives two Monte-Carlo trajectories from reactants to products and vice versa, until the trajectories meet. The trajectories are driven in a Metropolis-like procedure with transition probabilities based on the real-space diffusion Monte-Carlo algorithm. A computationally inexpensive structure preselection procedure is used to guide the two trajectories toward each other. We performed a proof-of-principle demonstration of the MCTSS algorithm for the model two-dimensional double-well potential and for the halogen anion SN2-substitution in halogenated methane.

At the atomistic scale, transmembrane voltage can be modeled thanks to the application of an external electric field. Here, we introduce a new QM/MM model capable of efficiently describing the interaction of QM and MM atoms with a static electric field (SEF) thanks to ElectroStatic Potential Fitted (ESPF) operators. A simple decomposition of the full interaction energy is proposed in terms of electrostatic QM/MM interactions and interactions of QM and MM multipoles with the SEF. Having validated the method and tested its limitations in the case of a short protonated Schiff base model, it is applied to the case of the Gloeobacter Rhodopsin, a transmembrane photoactive protein with potential applications in optogenetics.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-gc95h-v2,Velocity Rescaling in Surface Hopping Based on Atomic Contributions to Electronic Transitions,"Surface hopping is a widely used method for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics, in which nuclear motion follows classical trajectories and electronic transitions occur stochastically. To ensure energy conservation during these transitions, atomic velocities must be adjusted. Traditional velocity rescaling methods either apply a uniform adjustment to atomic velocities, which can lead to size consistency issues, or rely on nonadiabatic coupling vectors, which are computationally expensive and may not always be available. Here, we introduce two novel velocity rescaling methods that incorporate atomic contributions to electronic transitions, derived from the one-electron transition density matrix or the density difference between states for a given transition. The first method, excitation weighted velocity rescaling, redistributes kinetic energy among atoms proportionally to their contributions to the electronic transition. This is achieved through a weighted scaling factor, computed from the population analysis of the one-electron transition density matrix or the density difference of the two states involved in the transition. The second method, excitation-thresholded velocity rescaling, adjusts the velocities only of atoms whose contributions exceed a predefined threshold, preventing unnecessary energy redistribution to atoms with minimal involvement in the excitation. We validate these approaches through excited-state dynamics simulations of fulvene and 1H-1,2,3 triazole. Our results show that excitation-weighted velocity rescaling closely reproduces the adjustments based on nonadiabatic coupling vectors for both fulvene and 1H-1,2,3-triazole.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-07-31T09:29:15.926Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information for: ""Velocity Rescaling in Surface Hopping Based on Atomic Contributions to Electronic Transitions""', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688a015a728bf9025e0edf8b/original/supplementary-information-for-velocity-rescaling-in-surface-hopping-based-on-atomic-contributions-to-electronic-transitions.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688a0159728bf9025e0edf80/original/velocity-rescaling-in-surface-hopping-based-on-atomic-contributions-to-electronic-transitions.pdf

Our approach simultaneously parameterizes key dihedral angles in nucleic acids critical to simulating their conformations at physiologically relevant temperatures and solvent environments. The resulting FF, Creyon25, achieves accuracy comparable to the latest AMBER and CHARMM models, but our framework in contrast is generalizable to chemical modifications (in linker, sugar and base).  We validate Creyon25 across a wide range of RNA and DNA structures, including tetramers, tetraloops, and duplexes.

The use of electrostatic potential fitting (ESPF) approximation method to describe charge density fluctuations significantly improves the computational efficiency compared the integral-exact direct reaction field.

Firstly the development of efficient analytic energy gradients, enabling geometry optimization, transition state searches, and molecular dynamics, and secondly a formulation of periodic boundary conditions (PBC) compatible with the DREEM framework. These capabilities are implemented in the open-source OpenESPF code, interfacing PySCF and OpenMM for high-performance QM and MM calculations. We demonstrate that the resulting implementation enables practical simulations of excited-state optical properties in periodic polarizable environments, where we calculate the fluorescence spectrum of acetone in water including quantum vibronic and non-Condon effects.

In this work, we present a comparative study of four GPU-accelerated algorithms for evaluating the KS-DFT exchange-correlation (XC) potential with an atom-centered Gaussian basis. Two approaches, both leveraging batched dense linear algebra, are found to outperform the others across a suite of molecular benchmarks. We show that batched formation of the XC matrix from the density matrix yields the best performance for large (> O(10^3)) basis functions), sparse systems such as glycine chains and water clusters. In contrast, for smaller and denser systems such as diamond nanoparticles, especially if employing large basis sets, algorithms that use the underlying molecular orbital coefficients offer superior performance, despite their higher formal scaling. 
Our implementations deliver speedups of 1.4-5.2x for XC potential evaluation relative to leading GPU-accelerated KS-DFT codes, significantly lowering the computational cost and enabling the routine use of larger integration grids. Finally, we outline directions for continued performance improvements in light of emerging GPU architectures with emphasis on utilizing mixed-precision capabilities.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-07-29T08:38:20.901Z,"[{'title': 'GPU Accelerated Exchange-Correlation Functional Evaluation', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6884372c728bf9025e490e96/original/gpu-accelerated-exchange-correlation-functional-evaluation.zip'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688435b723be8e43d60f1497/original/efficient-algorithms-for-gpu-accelerated-evaluation-of-the-dft-exchange-correlation-functional.pdf
