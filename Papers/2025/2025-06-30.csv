10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bb1bx,BitterTranslate: A Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning-based Framework for Mapping Bitter Taste Receptor Agonism,"Bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed on the tongue and by many extraoral tissues. Identifying TAS2R ligands is an area of interest for improving bitter-drug compliance, treating various illnesses, and studying the receptors’ extraoral functions. Although machine learning, emerging as a promising tool for drug discovery, can in theory be used for predicting TAS2R activators, obtaining high-quality features from which the machine learning model can learn is time-intensive and reliant on specialized software. This work explores the potential of transformers (a neural network architecture that has revolutionized natural language processing-based tasks and is a powerful tool for extracting features from sequential biomolecular and chemical data) in computer-aided drug design, specifically for predicting potential ligands for TAS2R activation. We developed BitterTranslate, a screening algorithm to predict TAS2R agonists based solely on a Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) string of the ligand and the amino acid sequence of the TAS2R. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models trained on small molecules and GPCRs were used to extract ligand and receptor features. An XGBoost classifier was pre-trained on a large GPCR–ligand dataset and fine-tuned on the smaller TAS2R–ligand dataset. The algorithm predicts ligand associations with an 80% precision and 65% recall across all TAS2Rs and an 83% precision and 88% recall for the top receptor, TAS2R14. Since BitterTranslate performs reasonably well for TAS2Rs for which the data is scarce, it can be expected to perform even better for other more populated families of GPCRs with more ligand information available.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-06-27T09:50:19.194Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685bffd93ba0887c338fd99b/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685bf7b4c1cb1ecda0088c38/original/bitter-translate-a-natural-language-processing-and-machine-learning-based-framework-for-mapping-bitter-taste-receptor-agonism.pdf

Chemical practitioners are not immune to the appeal of foundation models, nor are they immune to the many risks and harms that these models introduce. In this work, I present the first analysis of foundation models using the combined lens of scientific ethics and chemical professional ethics. I find that general-purpose generative foundation models are in many ways incompatible with the ethical practice of chemistry, though there are fewer ethical problems with chemistry-specific foundation models. My discussion concludes with an examination of how the harm associated with foundation models can be minimized and further poses a set of lingering questions for chemical practitioners and scientific ethicists.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Education; Chemical Education - General; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-06-26T05:05:09.060Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68598b131a8f9bdab524a6a7/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68598b131a8f9bdab524a69b/original/considering-the-ethics-of-large-machine-learning-models-in-the-chemical-sciences.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-dm67f,Integrating Bilinear Transduction with Message Passing Neural Networks for Improved ADMET Property Prediction,"With the increasing application of machine learning and deep learning in drug discovery comes the significant challenge of addressing censored molecular property datasets. Pharmaceutical assays frequently generate censored data where measurement limitations prevent recording exact values beyond predetermined thresholds. Standard deep learning approaches struggle with this censoring, often producing systematic prediction errors even for in-distribution molecules. Building on the established strengths of Chemprop and the concept of bilinear transduction, we present a method that integrates bilinear transduction into the Chemprop message-passing neural network. This integration allows us to effectively leverage domain-specific structural relationships between molecules, addressing current limitations in molecular property prediction. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties demonstrate that our method outperforms standard D-MPNN baselines, with improvements exceeding 100% for heavily censored datasets like CYP2C9 inhibition and CYP2D6 inhibition. This practical solution requires no additional experimental measurements while improving ADMET property prediction accuracy, particularly in the challenging high-censoring regimes common in pharmaceutical research.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-06-25T15:48:10.497Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6858f0401a8f9bdab50eb93a/original/integrating-bilinear-transduction-with-message-passing-neural-networks-for-improved-admet-property-prediction.pdf

However, despite excelling on fixed test sets, machine-learned potentials remain prone to instability when deployed in molecular dynamics simulations, particularly at elevated temperatures. Here we present the first physics-informed Gaussian process (GP)-based atomic energy models that achieve practically unlimited stability in NVT simulations at temperatures as high as 1000 K. Our findings highlight the importance of the GP prior mean function and demonstrate the models' ability to predict restoring forces that preserve the system’s physical integrity. The quantum chemical topology information embedded in these models acts as an inductive bias to mitigate arbitrary fluctuations in the predicted atomic energies. Finally, the models' robustness is evidenced by 50 successful simulations of four flexible organic molecules (peptide-capped glycine and serine, malondialdehyde and aspirin) yielding a cumulative simulation time of 0.5 microsecond completed within two CPU days.

Such predictions rely on the accurate determination of solvation free energies for ions. However, the limited availability of high-quality reference data poses a challenge in developing accurate, inexpensive computational prediction methods. In this study, we address both issues of data quality and availability. We present three databases and models related to ionic phenomena: 1 (1) 8,241 pK a datapoints across 8 solvents, (2) 5,536 gas-phase acidities from DLPNO- CCSD(T) QM calculations, and (3) 6,090 solvation free energies of anions across 8 solvents obtained from a thermodynamic cycle. We also report 6,088 solvation free energies of neutral conjugate solutes computed using the COSMO-RS method. The pKa data were obtained from the iBonD database, cleaned, and combined with a separate compilation of trustworthy reference pKa data. Gas-phase acidities were computed for most of the acids present in the pKa corpus. Leveraging these data, we compiled values for solvation free energies of anions. We then trained several graph neural network models, which can be used as an alternative to QM approaches to quickly estimate these properties. The pKa and gas-phase acidity models accept reaction SMILES strings of the acid dissociation as inputs, whereas the solvation energy model accepts the SMILES string of the anion. Our microscopic pKa model achieves good accuracy, with an overall test mean average error of 0.58 units on unseen solutes and 0.59 on the SAMPL7 challenge (the lowest error so far among multi-solvent models). Our gas-phase acidity model had mean absolute errors slightly above 2 kcal/mol when evaluated against experimental data. The anionic solvation free energy model had mean absolute errors of less than 3 kcal/mol in several test evaluations, comparable to (though less reliable than) several widely-used QM-based solvation models.

Alternative Modes for Protein Binding,"A large body of research is oriented towards the determination of the mechanism of action of food compounds at the molecular level, in order to rationalize the important role of these molecules in health, and as source of new drugs. In this work we perform a systematic analysis of all the food-protein complexes at atomic resolution present in the Protein Data Bank. We analyze both the interaction types used in their binding, as well as the functional groups involved in these. For the analysis, food compounds are divided into a set of molecules derived from fatty lipids (FoodFL, which includes glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and fatty acyls), and the rest of the molecules (FoodnoFL), since these correspond to highly dissimilar chemical spaces. As a control, a set of drugs is used. From this analysis it is found that the three compound sets provide very different solutions to the protein-ligand binding problem. FoodnoFL compounds stabilize their binding mainly through hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, cation-π interactions, and metal coordination, while FoodFL do so through hydrophobics and close contacts. In turn, drugs prefer the use of hydrophobic, π-π, cation-π, and halogen bonds interactions. These differences result from differences in the types and relative abundances of functional groups, and/or differential usage of interaction types by the same functional groups. This knowledge can be exploited in the design new drugs inspired in food compounds.

This set provides a challenging benchmark for testing, validation, and training of density functional approximations (DFAs), semiempirical methods, force fields, and machine learning potentials using molecular structures beyond the conventional chemical space.

The most stable Au$_8$ conformer was then used to probe CO adsorption, demonstrating that CO preferentially binds to the most negatively charged undercoordinated Au sites. These findings highlight how defect‑mediated charge transfer and cluster morphology together dictate adsorption behavior and catalytic functionality on oxide supports.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Clusters,2025-06-26T07:58:24.473Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685a2b0b1a8f9bdab539076a/original/supporting-information.pdf'}, {'title': 'Video S1', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685a409a1a8f9bdab53c6e37/original/video-s1.mp4'}, {'title': 'Video S2', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685a56091a8f9bdab53ecd05/original/video-s2.mp4'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685a28eac1cb1ecda0bb71f6/original/dynamics-of-gold-nanocluster-on-mg-o-surface-with-f-center-defect.pdf

While various methods have been proposed for RR prediction, prior efforts have been limited by a lack of data accessibility, model interpretability, and out-of-distribution performance on new chemical spaces. We address these challenges by assembling a dataset of copolymer RRs extracted from the experimental literature and then developing a machine learning model that demonstrates robustness in predicting RRs for diverse monomers and radical chemistries.  SHAP analysis of the machine learning model reveals the significant role of frontier molecular orbital interactions, corroborating earlier RR prediction models emphasizing the bipolar reactivity of radicals in copolymerization.

However, their large computational demands limit their accessibility, leading to the development of Small Language Models (SLMs), which, by running locally on a microcomputer, made AI-driven language processing and enhanced control for text analysis widely accessible. In this work, we use an SLM to analyze the evolution of Chemistry in Brazil by comparing data from the 2019 and 2024 Brazilian Chemical Society meetings (RASBQ). These annual meetings have been gathering over 2,000 researchers of all levels since 1978. We demonstrate the viability of SLMs for extracting and structuring large volumes of text from scientific events collected in annals or books of abstracts, thus enabling comprehensive comparative analyses that would otherwise be impractical. Our methodology extracts abstracts from the RASBQ digital proceedings and processes them using SLMs. These models converted the textual content into structured, manipulable data, thus enabling us to conduct a semantic and statistical analysis of the two events. The results highlight how SLMs can efficiently transform unstructured scientific proceedings into tractable data, thereby saving significant time and resources. The comparison between the 2019 and 2024 events revealed notable changes in thematic distribution, institutional participation, and potential regional impacts, underscoring the importance of data standardization in automated analyses.

Computational crystal structure prediction (CSP) workflows typically rank candidate structures by lattice energy to assess relative stability. Approaches using self-consistent first-principles calculations become prohibitively expensive, especially when millions of energy evaluations are required for complex molecular systems with many atoms per unit cell. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of our methodology and results from the seventh blind test of crystal structure prediction organized by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC). We present an approach that significantly accelerates CSP by training target-specific machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). AIMNet2 MLIPs are trained on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of molecular clusters, herein referred to as n-mers. We demonstrate that potentials trained on gas phase dispersion-corrected DFT reference data of n-mers successfully extend to crystalline environments, accurately characterizing the CSP landscape and correctly ranking structures by relative stability. Our methodology effectively captures the underlying physics of thermodynamic crystal stability using only molecular cluster data, avoiding the need for expensive periodic calculations.

However, the rational design of catalysts for this reaction is undermined by insufficient understanding of their reaction networks and the critical role of coordinatively unsaturated sites for the catalyst activity. Here, we address this gap by developing a data- and computation-efficient framework for exploring CO₂ hydrogenation to C1 and C2 oxygenates on nanoparticles of transition metals, namely, Au, fcc-Co, Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt, and Rh. Our approach integrates DFT and a neural network model to predict activation barriers with high accuracy (MAE < 0.23 eV) and generalizability even in the low-data regime. The NN leverages Coulomb matrices for molecular structures, one-hot encoding for metal identity and transition state geometries, enabling robust predictions of activation barriers even for underrepresented classes of elementary steps. Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relationships reveal that electropositive metals (Co and Ni) favor C–O cleavage, while electronegative metals (Cu and Au) are highly active in C–C coupling. By evaluating catalyst activity based on the energetic span model implemented in an automatic fashion to efficiently analyze extended reaction networks, we construct Sabatier volcano plots and identify Rh as the best monometallic catalyst for CO₂ hydrogenation into C2 products.

Despite progress in machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we demonstrate that available models lack the accuracy for diverse reaction modeling. With this motivation, we developed a general MLIP for mechanistic modeling of organics, AIMNet2-rxn, using a dataset of ~4.7 x 106 range-separated DFT calculations. AIMNet2-rxn enables reaction modeling ~106 faster than the reference quantum mechanical (QM) methods while significantly outperforming graph-based ML, reaffirming the value using 3D chemical information for training. On a test suite of well-known reaction mechanisms—such as amide formation, proton transfers, and pericyclics—AIMNet2-rxn yields 1-2 kcal mol-1 accuracy across reaction coordinates without retraining or system-specific fine-tuning. To exploit GPU parallelism and AIMNet2-rxn efficiency, we introduce a batched nudged elastic band (BNEB) method that readily achieves minimum energy pathway search on a millions-of-reactions scale. To demonstrate complex reaction characterization, the thermodynamics of an 11-step pathway producing hydroxymethylfurfural, the experimentally observed major product of glucose pyrolysis, is evaluated.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2tld1,Condensation of Forcefield parameters from Machine Learning predicted statistical distributions for High-Throughput Virtual screening applications,"Transferable Forcefields have been widely used in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. However, once parametrized on a given dataset, it is difficult to refit them on new chemical entities. On the other hand, Machine Learning Forcefields (MLFF) have gained attention for their accuracy and easiness in expanding related Applicability Domain (AD). Nonetheless, their prediction times make them incompatible with High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS) campaigns. Following the inverse of the widely adopted approach with transferable Forcefields, whose parameters are derived from QM data of representative molecules and then transferred to broader chemical spaces, we propose a condensation approach taking advantage from massive MLFF parameters prediction and improve  30x computational efficiency without over-sacrificing accuracy. When tested on the public release of the OpenFF Industry Benchmark Season 1 v1.1 dataset, the molecular structures optimized by minimizing the Potential Energy Surface built with condensed FF parameters only show a minor decrease in Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) and Torsion Fingerprint Deviations (TFD) performances compared to those obtained using FF parameters predicted at runtime.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vr3zd,Capturing Local Compositional Fluctuations in NMR Modelling of Solid Solutions,"Understanding the atomic-scale local properties of solid solutions is crucial for deciphering their structure-property relationships. In this work, we present a computational approach that combines solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate local chemical environments in solid solutions. Previous canonical ensemble models, which only sample configurations at a fixed composition of the simulation cell, fail to capture local compositional fluctuations that can significantly influence the NMR spectra. To address this limitation, we employ a grand-canonical ensemble approach enabling a more comprehensive representation of the contributions of all possible local chemical environment to the NMR spectrum, using a La2(Zr1–xSnx)2O7 pyrochlore solid solution as a case study. To mitigate the high computational cost of such simulations, we also explore ensemble truncation strategies and the use of machine learning (ML) to aid predictions of NMR chemical shifts, achieving a significant reduction in computational demand while maintaining accuracy. Our results show that combining the grand-canonical approach with machine learning and ensemble truncation offers an efficient framework for modelling and interpreting NMR spectra in disordered crystalline materials.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ztskm-v2,Coarse-Grained Simulations of Sulfanilamide and Hexachlorobenzene Mobility in Soil Organic Matter,"Soil organic matter (SOM) is a complex and heterogeneous molecular system, crucial for soil health and ecosystem functioning. However, the release of pollutant molecules into the environment poses a significant environmental threat. Mechanisms that are governed by the interactions of these pollutants with SOM at the molecular level remain largely unexplored. In this study, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the behavior of Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and Sulfanilamide (SAA) in humic substance (HS) systems with varying compositions. Diffusion coefficients indicated a strong influence of water on SAA, with SAA displaying higher mobility, whereas HCB exhibited greater accumulation in the HS phase. Calculations of spatial distributions supported these observations, showing that SAA is predominantly situated in the water phase, while HCB’s interaction was influenced by the hydrophobicity of the SOM system. Simulations in the microsecond range, which were possible by the coarse-grained representation, revealed temporary trapping of SAA in the SOM matrix. These were anti-correlated with water diffusion, while HCB’s behavior was dominated by direct pollutant-SOM interactions. This approach provides novel insights into the trapping processes of pollutants in SOM and offers a realistic representation of molecular interactions at larger spatial and temporal scales. The proposed method enhances our understanding of pollutant mobility in soil systems, thus enabling future studies on the ecological impact of pollutant-SOM interactions.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Physical and Chemical Processes,2025-06-26T11:15:14.655Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information Coarse-Grained Simulations of Sulfanilamide and Hexachlorobenzene Mobility in Soil Organic Matter', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685bc3fd1a8f9bdab579e716/original/supporting-information-coarse-grained-simulations-of-sulfanilamide-and-hexachlorobenzene-mobility-in-soil-organic-matter.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685bc3fd1a8f9bdab579e70c/original/coarse-grained-simulations-of-sulfanilamide-and-hexachlorobenzene-mobility-in-soil-organic-matter.pdf

In this work, we develop a thermodynamic integration scheme based on an electrostatic embedding QM/MM approach for efficiently computing solvation energies and redox potentials in condensed-phase systems. This method is compatible with both ab initio DFT and semi-empirical DFTB QM/MM frameworks in periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Our PBC-adapted QM/MM model employs a mixed particle–mesh Ewald (PME) scheme for QM–MM interactions and an Ewald pair potential for QM–QM interactions, enhancing computational efficiency. For solvation free energies, we introduce two coupling parameters to decouple electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. Redox potentials are computed using a fractional electron occupation scheme interpolating between N- and N±1-electron states. The method is applied to aqueous solvation of amino acid analogues and to redox processes in water, yielding results in good agreement with experimental data.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-86948,Physicochemical Characterization of MMP-14 Active Site–Zn(II)–Peptide Inhibitor Ternary Complexes: A Strategy for Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibition in Cancer Progression.,"
Cancer metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), i.a. the membrane-bound MMP-14, play pivotal roles in tumor progression through extracellular matrix degradation and angiogenesis promotion. The catalytic activity of MMPs is critically dependent on Zn(II) coordination, making the zinc-binding site an attractive target for inhibitor design. This study investigates the thermodynamic properties of Zn(II) complexes with active site of MMP-14 and selected four peptide-based inhibitors, focusing on inhibitor’s potential to disrupt enzymatic activity by incorporating to the Zn(II) coordination sphere. The research utilized complementary analytical techniques including potentiometric titrations, mass spectrometry (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize the stoichiometry, donor atom preferences, and thermodynamic stability of binary Zn(II)-MMP-14/inhibitor, and ternary Zn(II)-MMP-14-inhibitor complexes. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations further elucidated coordination modes and structural properties of ternary complexes. Results showed that Zn(II) binding affinity depends on multiple factors beyond simply the number of histidine residues in the inhibitors, including their spatial arrangement and local environment. The most stable ternary Zn(II)-MMP-14-inhibitor complex was formed by inhibitor 1 (SDMAHSLPGHSH), which coordinates Zn(II) through aspartic acid, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and DFT. The formation of cooperative hydrogen bonding networks contributed significantly to the stability of the Zn(II)-MMP-14-Inh1 complex, mirroring interactions observed in natural MMP-14 inhibitors such as TIMP-2. This comprehensive analysis provides critical insights into the coordination chemistry of Zn(II) within the MMP active site and its interactions with potential inhibitors, establishing a molecular foundation for rational design of selective MMP inhibitors with therapeutic potential.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Biochemistry,2025-06-25T13:21:27.848Z,"[{'title': 'Physicochemical Characterization of MMP-14 Active Site–Zn(II)–Peptide Inhibitor Ternary Complexes: A Strategy for Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibition in Cancer Progression - Supplementary Materials', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685981123ba0887c332c04c8/original/physicochemical-characterization-of-mmp-14-active-site-zn-ii-peptide-inhibitor-ternary-complexes-a-strategy-for-matrix-metalloproteinase-inhibition-in-cancer-progression-supplementary-materials.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68597eb4c1cb1ecda0a628ad/original/physicochemical-characterization-of-mmp-14-active-site-zn-ii-peptide-inhibitor-ternary-complexes-a-strategy-for-matrix-metalloproteinase-inhibition-in-cancer-progression.pdf

Designed to bridge the gap between semi-empirical quantum mechanical (SQM) approaches and DFT in terms of accuracy, robustness, and general applicability, g-xTB targets the performance of the ωB97M-V range-separated hybrid density functional with large basis sets while maintaining TB speed. Key innovations include an atom-in-molecule adaptive atomic orbital basis, a refined Hamiltonian incorporating range-separated approximate Fock exchange, up to fourth-order charge-fluctuation terms with a novel first-order electronic contribution, and atomic correction potentials (ACPs), as well as a charge-dependent semi-classical repulsion function. Parameterized on extended and extremely diverse molecular training sets – including “mindless molecules” – g-xTB achieves excellent accuracy across a broad chemical space, including the actinide elements. Benchmarking against around 32k relative energies across thermochemistry, conformational energetics, non-covalent interactions, and reaction barriers shows that g-xTB consistently outperforms GFN2-xTB, often reducing mean absolute errors by half. Notably, it achieves a WTMAD-2 of 9.3 kcal mol−1 on the full GMTKN55 benchmark, comparable to low-cost DFT methods. It also shows substantial improvements for transition-metal complexes, relative spin state energies, and orbital energy gaps – areas where many SQM and even DFT methods often struggle. In summary, g-xTB offers DFT-like accuracy with minimal computational overhead compared to its predecessor, GFN2-xTB, making it a robust, minimally empirical, transferable, and efficient alternative to machine learning interatomic potentials for a wide range of molecular simulations. It is proposed as a general replacement for the GFNn-xTB family and, in many practical cases, a viable substitute for low- and mid-level DFT methods.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-06-24T05:11:28.203Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68555709c1cb1ecda0061157/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685434533ba0887c335fc974/original/g-x-tb-a-general-purpose-extended-tight-binding-electronic-structure-method-for-the-elements-h-to-lr-z-1-103.pdf

Formulation and Application to an Fe(II)  Compound,"A protocol for generating potential energy surfaces and performing  photoinduced nonadiabatic multidimensional wave packet propagation is presented. The workflow starts with the parameterization of a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) Hamiltonian using the BSE@GW approach. In a second step, the LVC model is used as input for multi-layer multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) wave packet propagation. To facilitate automated ML tree generation, a spectral clustering algorithm is applied based on a correlation matrix obtained from nuclear coordinate expectation values of a full-dimensional Time-dependent Hartree (TDH) simulation. The performance of the protocol is tested on the photoinduced spin-vibronic dynamics of a transition metal complex, [Fe(cpmp)]$^{+2}$. For this example, it is shown that BSE@GW provides a more robust description of the character of the transitions contributing to the absorption spectrum compared to TD-DFT. Furthermore, the LVC parameterization is tested against explicit calculations of potential energy curves to find the validity of the linear approximation over a wide range of normal mode elongation. Finally, the flexibility of spectral clustering is used to generate different ML trees, resulting in very different numerical efficiencies for ML-MCTDH propagation. In terms of electronic structure and dimensionality, [Fe(cpmp)]$^{+2}$ is a challenging example, suggesting that the new protocol should be applicable to a wide range of systems.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rb48g,Molecular Density Functional Theory with AtomisticDipolar Solvent to Study Pressure Effect on a Diels-AlderReaction,"In the present work, we have extended molecular Density Functional Theory (MDFT) to study model solvents at high pressure and how chemical reactivity can be modified. Notably, we have considered an example of Diels-Alder reaction in model apolar (CCl4) and polar (CH2Cl2) solvents.MDFT allows to calculate solvation free energies for different chemical structures along the reaction pathway at different pressures. These energies, combined with (electronic) density functional theory calculations providing energetic differences between reactants, transitions states, intermediates and products, allow us to obtain the reaction free energy profiles in a large pressure range (from ambient to 1.5 GPa). Special attention was paid to the role of the solvent dielectric response and its influence on reaction kinetics. The model makes it possible to reproduce the experimental dielectric constant at intermediate pressures (0-0.2 GPa) and to infer its increase at high pressures in the GPa range.The numerical findings are in line with the experimental observations, proving that the reaction is promoted by high pressures and that a trans/cis diastereoselectivity is induced in the product distribution.  It is shown that the electrostatic interactions play a major role in these findings.Finally, we can obtain the activation volume, which is a reference quantity in pressure dependentreactivity, as a direct results of our calculations, with values in agreement with what experimentally typically observed.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Statistical Mechanics,2025-06-25T12:35:32.566Z,"[{'title': 'Geometries', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685964e53ba0887c3328d8a9/original/geometries.zip'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685962043ba0887c332885a2/original/molecular-density-functional-theory-with-atomistic-dipolar-solvent-to-study-pressure-effect-on-a-diels-alder-reaction.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-wqp98,The approximate second order coupled-cluster method based on a size-consistent Brillouin-Wigner partitioning,"We present a variant of the approximate second order coupled-cluster method (CC2) with a two parameter size- consistent Brillouin-Wigner (BW-s) partitioning instead of a Møller-Plesset (MP) partitioning for the unperturbed Hamiltonian, which we refer to as BWs-CC2. The computational complexity of this model scales identically to CC2 with molecular size. Conventional CC2 and its regularized BWs-CC2 variants, as well as conventional MP2 and two of its regularized BW-s2 variants were assessed on a 535 element database spanning thermochemistry, non-covalent interactions, barrier heights and isomerization energies. The assessment was performed using internally stable spin- polarized Hartree-Fock (HF) orbitals in the finite aug-cc-pVQZ basis without counterpoise corrections. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that CC2 substantially outperforms MP2 on molecules, showing the value of its single substitutions. While no single choice of regularization parameters can be optimal for all datasets, we find that BWs- CC2 generally outperforms both CC2, and BW-s2 with a single judicious parameter choice. Additional tests on dipole moments and bond-lengths of diatomics provide further support for the utility of this choice. The main outliers and poorest performing cases are associated with large amounts of spin-contamination in the HF reference, which is indicative of systems with either strong correlation or extensive artificial symmetry breaking. Overall, these findings argue that the perception of the quality of the CC2 ground state should be reevaluated and that it can be further improved upon by the soundly based BWs-CC2 variant with the recommended parameter choice.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Quantum Mechanics,2025-06-24T13:22:38.876Z,"[{'title': 'Electronic Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6856c36d1a8f9bdab5bf69ea/original/electronic-supporting-information.tar'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6856c184c1cb1ecda0421aac/original/the-approximate-second-order-coupled-cluster-method-based-on-a-size-consistent-brillouin-wigner-partitioning.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-s6k1m,The Role of Intrinsic Electric Fields and 2-His-1-Carboxylate/Chloride Facial Triads in Modulating Reactivity of the 2-Oxoglutarate Dependent Enzymes,"Iron (II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (Fe(II)/2OG) oxygenases form a large family of non-heme enzymes containing the Fe(II) center coordinated by two histidine residues and either a carboxylate or halide ligand, with 2OG acting as a co-substrate. Although these enzymes share a conserved 2-His-1-carboxylate/halide motif in their active sites, they catalyze a wide variety of oxidative chemical reactions. We here investigate two factors that can significantly impact the divergence in their observed catalytic functions, namely, the intrinsic electric field (IEF) exerted on the active site by the surrounding protein environment, and variations of the composition of the facial triad. Concretely, we first evaluate the IEFs in Fe(II)/2OG oxygenases and investigate whether the direction and magnitude of these computed IEFs correlate with catalytic function across multiple subfamilies of Fe(II)/2OG oxygenases. We also examine how these IEFs can influence the geometric and electronic structures of Fe(III)-superoxo intermediates formed in the active site of Fe(II)/2OG oxygenases upon binding O2, the initial step of their oxidative catalytic cycles. Additionally, we evaluated the role of the identity and orientation of the third ligand (Glu, Asp, or Cl) in the 2-His-1-carboxylate/halide facial triad in modulating the reactivity of the active site complexes. Our findings suggest that specific steps in the catalytic cycle are determined by the interplay between the IEF due to the protein environment and the structural features of the facial triad. The results of this study provide insights into the role of IEFs and the facial triads in the observed divergency of reactivity of Fe(II)/2OG enzymes.

We report results of electric dipole-electric dipole polarizability, optical rotation, and electronic excitation energies (computed as poles of the LR function) on a series of 1D and 3D periodic systems. The basis sets employed are based on the Dunning series: cc-pVXZ, with X ranging from double-ζ to quintuple-ζ and include the bases augmented with diffuse functions: aug-cc-pVXZ. The calculations are possible thanks to an extension of the coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham code in the GAUSSIAN software to work with a different number of orbitals at each k point in reciprocal space, as orbitals with small overlap eigenvalues are projected out during the orthonormalization procedure of the basis set before the self-consistent field procedure used to evaluate the energy.
