10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zd9mr,A Computational Community Blind Challenge on Pan-Coronavirus Drug Discovery Data,"Computational blind challenges offer critical, unbiased assessment opportunities to assess and accelerate scientific progress, as demonstrated by a breadth of breakthroughs over the last decade. We report the outcomes and key insights from an open science community blind challenge focused on computational methods in drug discovery, using lead optimization data from the AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) Discovery Consortium’s pan-coronavirus antiviral discovery program, in partnership with Polaris and the OpenADMET project. This collaborative initiative invited global participants from both academia and industry to develop and apply computational methods to predict the biochemical potency and crystallographic ligand poses of small molecules against key coronavirus targets, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) main protease (Mpro), as well as multiple ADMET assay endpoints, using previously undisclosed comprehensive experimental drug discovery datasets as benchmarks. By evaluating submissions across multiple tasks and compounds, we established performance leaderboards and conducted meta-analyses to assess methodological strengths, common pitfalls, and areas for improvement. This analysis provides a foundation for best practices in real-world machine learning evaluation, grounded in community-driven benchmarking. We also highlight how next-generation platforms, such as Polaris, enable rigorous challenge design, embedded evaluation frameworks, and broad community engagement. This paper reports the collective findings of the challenge, offering a high-level overview of the data, evaluation infrastructure, and top- performing strategies. We further provide context and support for the accompanying papers authored by the challenge participants in this special issue, which explore individual approaches in greater depth. Together, these contributions aim to advance reproducible, trustworthy, and high-impact computational methods in drug discovery, and to explore best practices and pitfalls in future blind challenge design and execution, including planned initiatives for the OpenADMET project.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence,2025-07-25T09:37:46.167Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Figures', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6878d5a2fc5f0acb52aad7df/original/supplementary-figures.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6878bef4fc5f0acb52a813f5/original/a-computational-community-blind-challenge-on-pan-coronavirus-drug-discovery-data.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xqmt3,Robust Prediction of Protein–Ligand Binding Potency with Multi-Modal Customized Gate Control ,"The main protease (Mpro) is a critical target in the design of antiviral drugs against coronaviruses, while accurately predicting the binding affinity between small molecules and this target remains a key challenge. In the recent Polaris challenge of blind drug-potency prediction targeting SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV Mpro, we developed a multi-modal multi-task graph attention network based on the customized gate control framework (abbreviated as MultiMolCGC). Our team achieved top performance among all participating teams in the blind prediction challenge. In this paper, we detail the model development and further explorations in terms of pretraining, adjusting the model architecture, and many others. Our model consistently outperforms traditional machine learning baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of end-to-end deep learning in capturing complex molecular interactions. Integrating multi-modal representations proved essential, and the multi-task specialized gating architecture outperformed both single-task and non-specialized multi-task variants, highlighting the value of tailored knowledge sharing. While auxiliary loss weighting and hyperparameter tuning offered modest improvements, incorporating predicted structural data unexpectedly reduced performance, likely due to structural uncertainty. Notably, pretraining on large-scale synthetic docking datasets significantly enhanced performance in low-data scenarios, reducing dependence on experimental pIC50 data. The numerical results highlight the potential of MultiMolCGC as a robust and accurate deep-learning framework for protein-ligand binding in future study.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-sbc0c,Closing the synthesis gap in computational materials design,"Data-driven strategies are reshaping computational materials design by accelerating the prediction of novel compounds with targeted functionalities. Beyond high-throughput screening, the integration of generative artificial intelligence enables exploration across vast chemical spaces comprising millions of known and hypothetical materials. This abundance of candidates presents a challenge: identifying which candidate compounds are not only low in energy, but also synthetically accessible. We assess advances towards closing this synthesis gap for inorganic crystals. These include the incorporation of thermodynamic potentials (from internal energies at 0 K to Gibbs free energies), crucial for evaluating phase stability and reaction driving forces, chemical heuristics (from charge neutrality to electronegativity rules), and machine learning models (from positive–unlabelled learning to large language models) to guide compound selection and prioritisation. Looking forward, the development of more robust synthesisability metrics, synthesis planning tools, and agentic workflows integrating experimental feedback will narrow the divide between virtual screening and real-world materials realisation.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Physical and Chemical Processes; Materials Chemistry,2025-07-22T12:56:02.048Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687ce72323be8e43d628846f/original/closing-the-synthesis-gap-in-computational-materials-design.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kgb3s-v2,"Explainable artificial intelligence for materials
discovery: application to catalysts for the HER
and ORR","The extraordinary progress of strategies coupling ab initio calculations and machine learning (ML) has opened the door for both fast and accurate chemical/physical properties predictions and for the virtual design of materials. However, these techniques are very often used as a ""black box"" with the sole objective of obtaining high accuracy with scarce or no special attention on how ML models obtain their predictions.  This can be improved by leveraging explainability of ML models, which, at the same time, would increase the chance of ML to offer new insights into the chemistry and physics of materials. Hence, the next generation of ML models in these realms must guarantee explainability by embedding explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools into their pipelines. Specifically, ML-assisted materials discovery and design can take great advantage of the use of XAI. Enabling explanations would increase the impact of these approaches by providing not only a set of candidates, but also insights into what makes a given material better than others. With this in mind, on the example of heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrogen production and energy generation, here we propose a novel strategy for materials design based on counterfactuals explanations. We were able to find materials featuring properties close to the design targets that were later validated with density functional theory calculations. Explanations were devised by comparing original samples, counterfactuals, and discovered candidates. Such explanations allowed us to unveil subtle relationships between the most relevant features, other, in principle, less important features, and the target property.  This work provides an alternative to already available designing strategies, such as high-throughput screening or generative models, but that, for the first time, incorporates explainability as its main driving mechanism.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence,2025-07-22T05:11:19.895Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687a1b70728bf9025e1b131c/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687a1b70728bf9025e1b1313/original/explainable-artificial-intelligence-for-materials-discovery-application-to-catalysts-for-the-her-and-orr.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-w2kgt-v3,Graph-based prediction of reaction barrier heights with on-the-fly prediction of transition states,"The accurate prediction of reaction barrier heights is crucial for understanding chemical reactivity and guiding reaction design. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) models, particularly graph neural networks, have shown great promise in capturing complex chemical interactions. Here, directed message-passing neural networks (D-MPNNs) on graph overlays of the reactant and product structures were shown to provide promising accuracies for reaction property prediction. They rely solely on molecular graph changes as input and thus require no additional information during inference. However, the reaction barrier height intrinsically depends on the conformations of the reactants, transition state, and products, which are not taken into account in standard D-MPNNs. In this work, we present a hybrid approach where we combine the power of D-MPNNs predicting barrier heights with generative models predicting transition state geometries on-the-fly for organic reactions. The resulting model thus only requires two-dimensional graph information as input, while internally leveraging three-dimensional information to increase accuracy. We furthermore evaluate the influence of additional physical features on D-MPNN models of reaction barrier heights, where we find that additional features only marginally enhance predictive accuracy and are especially helpful for small datasets. In contrast, our hybrid graph/coordinate approach reduces the error of barrier height predictions for the two investigated datasets RDB7 and RGD1.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-07-22T04:48:52.265Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687a0d8d728bf9025e19ecdd/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687a0d8d728bf9025e19ecd0/original/graph-based-prediction-of-reaction-barrier-heights-with-on-the-fly-prediction-of-transition-states.pdf

By integrating thermodynamic consistencies and embedding equations of state, our model enforces Gibbs-Duhem relations to ensure physically realistic predictions. It also internally predicts component vapor pressures from limited data, enabling accurate activity coefficient predictions even for chemicals that lack tabulated vapor pressure values. With only SMILES representations, liquid-phase composition, and temperature data as inputs, the model demonstrates strong predictive performance, surpassing conventional methods such as UNIFAC and even the state-of-the-art HANNA model across a broad spectrum of binary mixtures. Our results further highlight the value of incorporating extended datasets made accessible through the model’s internal vapor pressure prediction module, enabling broader applicability without sacrificing accuracy. Through a rigorous comparison of various thermodynamic functional forms, we illustrate the impact of physically grounded architectures on model performance. Finally, we introduce a public benchmark dataset for phase-equilibria prediction, providing a foundation for further development and transparent evaluation of machine learning approaches in thermodynamic modeling.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Chem.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-f52qs,Learning Crystallographic Disorder: Bridging Prediction and Experiment in Materials Discovery,"Recent computational materials discovery efforts have led to an enormous number of predictions of previously unknown, potentially stable inorganic, crystalline compounds. In particular, both high-throughput screenings and generative models have benefited tremendously from recent advances in computational resources and available data. However, these efforts are currently limited to predicting pristine crystalline materials. As a consequence, many of these predictions cannot be realized in experiments, where kinetic effects, defects, and crystallographic disorder can be crucial. To address this shortcoming, the current work aims to introduce disorder into computational materials discovery with machine learning (ML) based classification models. Trained on the inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD), these classifiers capture the chemical trends of crystallographic disorder and estimate the prevalence of disorder in computational databases produced by the Materials Project or Graph Networks for Materials Science (GNoME) initiatives. This opens the door towards disorder-aware computational materials discovery workflows, bridging the gap between prediction and experiment",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry,2025-07-25T06:30:51.024Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68813131fc5f0acb529d317d/original/learning-crystallographic-disorder-bridging-prediction-and-experiment-in-materials-discovery.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jft1k,ML/MM toolkit – Towards Accelerated Mechanistic Investigation of Enzymatic Reactions,"Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods have long been used to analyze enzymatic reaction mechanisms in silico. While treating the active site with QM and the remainder with MM reduces the computational cost, the inherently high computational cost of the QM calculation is still a major limitation for their application to a wide variety of enzymes. Replacing QM with machine-learning (ML) interatomic potentials yields ML/MM approaches that can further reduce computational cost while retaining accuracy.
　Here, we developed ML/MM toolkit, an open-source collection of a core implementation of the ML/MM methods, ML/MM calculator, and associated command-line tools, employing Meta’s Universal Model for Atoms (UMA) as the ML interatomic potentials. This toolkit streamlines the workflow necessary for the enzymatic reaction mechanism analyses such as energy minimization, transition-state (TS) search, and vibrational analysis to calculate the reaction free energy (∆G) and activation free energy (∆G‡) for a given enzyme–substrate complex structure. A link atom boundary treatment is implemented to include amino-acid residues in the ML region and full-system Hessians are available for TS searches and vibrational analyses. To accelerate TS searches in systems comprising ≈ 10,000 atoms, we developed a Partial Hessian Guided Dimer (PHG-Dimer) method that uses the active-site Hessian to determine initial dimer orientation. We also integrated a mass-scaled flattening loop to suppress spurious imaginary modes. A test calculation on an enzymatic Claisen rearrangement reproduced its experimental and high-level QM/MM activation barriers to within a few kcal mol−1, while a full reaction-path workflow completed in under two hours on a single consumer GPU. Collectively, the ML/MM toolkit makes enzymatic mechanistic investigations more accessible.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Biocatalysis,2025-07-24T08:50:43.062Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686d4aeae1957b8c61d005f0/original/ml-mm-toolkit-towards-accelerated-mechanistic-investigation-of-enzymatic-reactions.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jmzwn,Combining Geometry and Topology for Accurate Protein Solubility Prediction,"Protein solubility is a key consideration for the production of proteins at industrial scales. Due to the complex and nonlinear nature of the physical processes involved in protein solubility, existing models exhibit poor predictive performance, necessitating costly trial-and-error experiments. We introduce TopoFormer, a novel combined topological-geometric equivariant neural network model capable of predicting binary protein solubility from OpenFold predicted 3D structural data. To train the TopoFormer model, the 3DProtSolDB structural dataset was created from OpenFold predictions of experimental protein solubility measurements in the literature. Concurrently, we assembled the 3DProtSolDB-Expt dataset from corresponding structures in the RCSB PDB. The 3DProtSolDB-Expt dataset was used to train TopoCoder, a topological embedding model that captures secondary structure shape information. The resultant embeddings and corresponding 3DProtSolDB structures were used to train the TopoFormer model. The trained TopoFormer model achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on a held-out test set. Additionally, model interpretability analyses reveal that the TopoFormer model acquires key physical insights into solvation behavior. These techniques are used to analyze the solubility of carbonic anhydrase mutants as reported in the literature. We find that metrics from the TopoFormer model correlate well with water survival probabilities from mo-lecular dynamics simulations, highlighting the utility of the trained model in guiding the rational design of soluble mutants.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning,2025-07-24T07:57:01.358Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68800cfffc5f0acb527f7722/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685aceb73ba0887c3357ae41/original/combining-geometry-and-topology-for-accurate-protein-solubility-prediction.pdf

Here, we improve upon a SOTA defect graph neural network (dGNN) surrogate model's oxygen vacancy predictions and combine them with Materials Project phase diagrams to down-select and discover structurally diverse, experimentally known metal oxides whose TCH performance was previously unknown. Amongst twelve candidates selected based on our high-throughput screening and down-selection criteria, we achieved ~80% accuracy in identifying materials with stable redox cycling and hydrogen production in stagnation flow reactor water-splitting experiments.  Closer to 100% accuracy can be achieved if higher-accuracy, hybrid DFT-predicted vacancy formation energies were computed and used in lieu of the most uncertain dGNN-based screening predictions, as they correct false positives to true negatives. Notably, two discovered candidates, Sr3PrMn2O6 and Ba2Fe2O5, display hydrogen yields greater than CeO2 under specific redox conditions.

Generative candidates are particularly useful for applications where few functional, let alone commercially viable, materials currently exist, such as metal oxides for thermochemical water-splitting, which have strict requirements for defect thermodynamics and host stability. Here, we critically examine generated metal oxides from the MatterGen diffusion model conditioned on select chemical systems for thermochemical water splitting applications. Perhaps most notably, we find that MatterGen predicts a novel, thermodynamically stable, quinary metal oxide Ba2SrInFeO6, although this compound represents an ordered and layered substitution within the same A3B2O6 structural prototype as its two ternary end members. Detailed DFT investigations and spin configuration sampling for this material and its possible decomposition products---beyond what existed in MatterGen training data---are required to validate hull energy predictions and can change the conclusion as to whether Ba2SrInFeO6 is below or slightly above the previously known energetic hull (-2 vs. 9 meV/atom above the existing hull, respectively). Nonetheless, the material exhibits oxygen defect formation energies appropriate for thermochemical water splitting, warranting targeted investigation in an experimental validation campaign, along with other future MatterGen candidates in this application space.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Fuels - Energy Science,2025-07-24T06:47:50.992Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687eaf36728bf9025e912168/original/metal-oxide-candidates-for-thermochemical-water-splitting-obtained-with-a-generative-diffusion-model.pdf

In this work, we have developed a procedure which combines experimental two-dimensional (2D) dipolar-based 27Al–29Si D-HMQC and MQMAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy with machine learning (ML) techniques to achieve a detailed and quantitative assignment of Al environments in zeolites. We applied this approach to investigate the Al distribution in RTH-type zeolites (Si/Al = 16 and 28), which contain four crystallographically distinct T-sites. A reactive ML potential was used to model framework dynamics under realistic conditions, including temperature and hydration, while kernel ridge regression enabled the accurate prediction of isotropic NMR chemical shifts. Comparison between theoretical and experimental spectra reveals that Al preferentially occupies the T2 (39 %) and T1 (27 %) sites, with lower populations in T3 (18 %) and T4 (16 %).

However, structural flexibility makes accurate and scalable property prediction difficult. While machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer a compelling balance between accuracy and efficiency, most existing models are system-specific and lack transferability across different MOFs. In this work, we introduce FFLAME (Fragment-to-Framework Learning Approach for MOF Potentials), a fragment-centric strategy for training transferable MLPs. By decomposing MOFs into their constituent metal clusters and organic linkers, FFLAME enables efficient reuse of chemical environments and significantly reduces the need for full-framework training data. We demonstrate that fragment-informed training improves model generalizability, particularly in data-scarce regimes, and accelerates convergence during fine-tuning.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ggp8n-v3,How to build machine learning models able to extrapolate from standard to modified peptides,"Bioactive peptides are an important class of natural products with great functional diversity. Chemical modifications can improve their pharmacology, yet their structural diversity presents unique challenges for computational modeling. Furthermore, data for standard peptides (composed of the 20 canonical amino acids) is more abundant than for modified ones. Thus, we set out to identify whether predictive models fitted to standard data are reliable when applied to modified peptides. To do this, we first considered two critical aspects of the modeling problem, namely, choice of similarity function for guiding dataset partitioning and choice of molecular representation. Similarity-based dataset partitioning is an evaluation technique that divides the dataset into train and test subsets, such that the molecules in the test set are different from those used to fit the model. We demonstrate, across four peptide function prediction tasks, that chemical fingerprint-based similarity measures outperform traditional sequence alignment-based metrics for partitioning standard peptide datasets, challenging usual practices. Similarly, we have found that chemical fingerprints are the best option for building predictive models able to interpolate between classes (standard to standard and modified to modified). Despite a 50% drop in performance, chemical fingerprints are also the best choice in the more challenging extrapolation scenario (standard to modified). All code and data necessary for reproducing the experiments are available in Github (https://github.com/IBM/PeptideGeneralizationBenchmark).",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-07-23T04:48:14.693Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687cfbff23be8e43d62a05f0/original/how-to-build-machine-learning-models-able-to-extrapolate-from-standard-to-modified-peptides.pdf

While Density Functional Theory (DFT) remains the mainstream method for transition state searches, inherent trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost persist. To bridge this gap, DeePEST-OS—a generic machine learning potential integrating Δ-learning with a high-order equivariant message passing neural network—is developed to enable rapid and precise transition state searches for organic synthesis. The challenge of reaction diversity is addressed through the establishment of a novel reaction database spanning 10 element types. DeePEST-OS rapidly predicts potential energy surfaces along intrinsic reaction coordinate pathways, achieving speeds nearly three orders of magnitude faster than rigorous DFT computations. High accuracy is simultaneously maintained, exhibiting a root mean square deviation of 0.14 Å for transition states geometries and a mean absolute error of 0.64 kcal/mol for reaction barriers across 1,000 external test reactions—representing significant improvement over semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods. Comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art React-OT model further highlights the superior precision and computational efficiency of DeePEST-OS.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mg7qj-v2,Modeling Diffusion in Metal-Organic Frameworks using On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling-based Machine Learning Potentials,"Machine learning potentials (MLPs) can help bridge the length- and time-scale gaps required to study diverse physicochemical phenomena in nanoporous materials with ab initio accuracy. These MLPs are typically trained on quantum chemical data obtained from traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that predominantly sample near-equilibrium configurations. This often limits the model’s ability to describe high-energy, off-equilibrium states required to study rare events. To address this capability gap, we introduce a novel active learning curriculum using the On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) method. Using imidazole diffusion in the SALEM-2 metal-organic framework (MOF) as a prototypical example, we apply time-dependent OPES biases with temperature- and distance-based collective variables to systematically sample the most relevant regions of the potential energy surface. This strategy enables nanosecond-scale MD simulations with near-DFT accuracy, capturing both the expected diffusion pathway across the 6-membered window and a previously unreported ring-opening mechanism through the more constrained 4-membered window. The latter process, which involves the transient dissociation of a Zn–N bond, cannot be captured using classical force fields and is prohibitively expensive with DFT. Thus, this study highlights how enhanced sampling methods can overcome data scarcity challenges associated with training MLPs for studying rare events in nanoporous materials.

Machine learning (ML) is a promising approach to accelerate materials discovery, yet accurate bandgap prediction remains a persistent challenge. This study finds that poor ML performance is not solely attributable to insufficient data or model robustness but rather to the intrinsic complexity and discontinuous nature of chemical space. The lack of a continuous trend in the periodic table fundamentally limits ML models, preventing them from leveraging systematic patterns. While smooth trends exist for properties like total and formation energies, bandgaps exhibit inherent fragmentation, leading models to memorize localized correlations rather than learn universal physical laws. Consequently, increasing dataset size fails to improve predictions. Thus, the core challenge of bandgap prediction lies not in model scale or complexity, but in bridging the discretized foundations of the periodic table itself.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry,2025-07-21T08:24:28.185Z,"[{'title': 'Supplemental information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68792379728bf9025efff6c7/original/supplemental-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68792116728bf9025effa74f/original/how-the-discreteness-of-the-periodic-table-undermines-machine-learning-predictions.pdf

Statistical models trained on a reported set of reactions can help predict out-of-sample transformations but often face two challenges: (1) only sparse data are available i.e., limited information on catalyst–substrate interactions, and (2) simple stereoelectronic parameters may fail to describe mechanistically complex transformations. Here we report a descriptor generation strategy that accounts for changes in the enantiodetermining step with catalyst or substrate identity, allowing us to model reactions involving distinct ligand and substrate types. As validating case studies, we collected data on enantioselective nickel-catalyzed C(sp3)-couplings and trained statistical models with features extracted from the transition states and intermediates involved in asymmetric induction. These models allow for the optimization of poorly performing examples reported in a substrate scope and are applicable to unseen ligands and reaction partners. This approach offers the opportunity to streamline catalyst and reaction development, quantitatively transferring knowledge learned on sparse data to novel chemical spaces.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Physical Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning,2025-07-21T05:29:25.790Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6878910bfc5f0acb52a2266d/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68788cb1728bf9025edbfa2f/original/low-cost-mechanism-informed-features-enable-transferable-enantioselectivity-predictions-from-sparse-data.pdf

We introduce a rigorous protocol for benchmarking DFAs for nonadiabatic dynamics regarding the initialization, the dynamics, and its evaluation. Different families of DFAs were compared with a high-level reference, highlighting that electronic populations are an unsuitable metric for evaluating the accuracy of dynamics. We found that several local functionals showed the best agreement of the population decay with the reference RMS-CASPT2, but strictly passed through a deactivation channel dominated by a single-bond torsion that is not accessible in the reference and in the literature.  While using 100% Hartree-Fock exchange in the functional yields the only correct isomerization behaviour, the time scales and quantum yields are far off the reference values, due to an artificial local minimum being predicted along the wrong torsion coordinate.  Static energy scans suggest that this issue can be circumvented by double hybrid functionals, in particular those balancing nonlocal exchange and correlation combined with range-separation. Indeed, they predict energy profiles along the two torsion coordinates in close agreement with the RMS-CASPT2 reference. This emphasizes the impact these DFAs will have on the field of nonadiabatic dynamics once analytical gradients are introduced.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-07-24T04:47:47.208Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information for: Benchmarking density functional approximations in nonadiabatic dynamics: trans-cis isomerization in retinal model', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687f4049fc5f0acb5267798d/original/supporting-information-for-benchmarking-density-functional-approximations-in-nonadiabatic-dynamics-trans-cis-isomerization-in-retinal-model.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687f3e2ffc5f0acb52670b39/original/benchmarking-density-functional-approximations-in-nonadiabatic-dynamics-trans-cis-isomerization-in-retinal-model.pdf

This complements the implementation of surface hopping approaches performed in previous works, and leads to a unified code that allows nonadiabatic dynamics simulations using various mapping approaches (Ehrenfest dynamics, the linearized semiclassical initial value representation, the Poisson-bracket mapping equation, the “unity” approach for the identity operator, the spin mapping, and the symmetrical quasiclassical windowing method) as well as different flavours of surface hopping (fewest-switches, Landau-Zener, and a mapping-inspired scheme). Furthermore, a plugin is developed to provide diabatic vibronic models as input in a sum-of-products form. This opens the way to the benchmark of different types of trajectory-based propagators on different models, against exact quantum dynamical simulations performed, e.g., by the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method.

Here, we predict these quantities from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of ribonuclease barnase with its inhibitor barstar. We characterized the detailed contribution of different residues at the interface, along with the role of water, identifying three distinct binding pathways. Using Langevin models, we inferred the free-energy and diffusion landscape of the process, hence the kinetic properties, systematically evaluating the model's quality across different collective variables, and obtaining robust dissociation rate predictions. Our computational scheme, based on unbiased molecular dynamics trajectories initialized in the dissociated state, is significantly simpler than previously proposed approaches,  and it is very data-efficient, requiring  tens of sub-microsecond simulations.

Predicting and understanding their elastic behavior is crucial for their application. However, a realistic calculation of their properties remains computationally challenging due to the ubiquitous presence of defects in synthesized 2DPs. Here, we introduce a coarse-graining (CG) approach based on elastic beams called MikadoRR with parameters extracted from simple regression-based fitting. This approach allows us to accurately calculate the elastic properties of defective 2DPs up to the microscale.

The experimental study of physical and chemical processes occurring in oceans remains challenging so that Molecular Dynamics simulations may be of great help. We have recently demonstrated that simulations using a state-of-the-art force field can accurately describe the thermophysical properties of seawater by employing a detailed chemical model of the solution. Here we extend our previous work by investigating additional properties that require simulations on larger samples and time length scales. First, the extended time and size scales of our simulations allow for a relatively precise determination of the electrical conductivity, a fundamental property of seawater for which accurate experimental data are available, serving as a further test of the employed force field. Second, the incorporation of CO2 to the sample enables us the evaluation of its diffusion coefficient. No experimental measurements or computational simulations have yet provided estimates of carbon dioxide diffusivity at salinity levels and composition representative of actual oceanic environments. To validate our results, we have also determined DCO2 in pure water. Our simulation results show excellent agreement with experimental data in pure water, which reinforces our confidence in the predicted CO2 diffusivity in seawater. This study, provides a rigorous test of the reliability of the Madrid-2019 force field (together with TraPPE for CO2 ) in saline environments. From this perspective, relevant challenges can be addressed, such as the sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide into the deeper ocean, CO2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers, and seawater freezing (for desalination purposes).",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.),2025-07-25T09:53:33.041Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6880a21a728bf9025eca8a5e/original/large-scale-simulations-of-a-detailed-molecular-model-of-seawater-ionic-conductivity-and-diffusion-coefficients-of-co2.pdf

However, studying single spins presents significant challenges both experimentally and theoretically, as radicals are often unstable in experimental conditions and sophisticated quantum mechanical approaches with extremely high computational demands, such as CASPT2 and NEVPT2, are often required. This has resulted in a limited understanding of many spin processes at the nanoscale, as emphasized by recent cutting-edge scanning probe microscopy experiments exploring conjugated hydrocarbons known as nanographenes: These systems have diradical character with two unpaired π-electrons in a non-Kekulé electronic structure that yields magnetic and electric properties not seen in classical hydrocarbons. In this work, we use a recently developed (range-separated) multi-configurational on-top pair-density density functional theory (MC–PDFT or MC–sr-PDFT) method to study the magnetic coupling in both small model non-Kekulé diradicals and models of nanographenes. We show that standard density functional theory fails to correctly describe those molecules whose ground state is a singlet instead of a triplet, sometimes considered a violation of Hund’s rule. Our method accounts for both static and dynamic correlation and com- pares well with common approaches like NEVPT2 and CASPT2, but exhibits a much lower asymptotic computational cost.

Through localized DFT calculations on 49 overlapping spherical cuts, we reconstruct global mutual informa- tion matrices at both the atomic and residue levels.

We employ several density functionals (CAM-B3LYP, M06-2X, BH&HLYP, and DTCAM-VAEE) in the MRSF-TDDFT calculations, and compare the results with those obtained with the SA-CASSCF and MS-CASPT2 methods. For the ethylene molecule, the dynamics results obtained with MRSF-TDDFT compare very well with those obtained with MS-CASPT2, and the results with different functionals are similar. For the DMABN and fulvene molecules, the dynamics results with different functionals show certain differences, while the DTCAM-VAEE functional performs best among all functionals compared to MS-CASPT2. Moreover, for all molecules, MRSF-TDDFT outperforms SA-CASSCF for all functionals used in this work. We further explain the discrepancies of the dynamics results with different electronic structure methods through reaction pathway analysis.

Many methods capture structural features well but often overestimate pressure, as computed by the virial theorem, due to thermodynamic representability issues. This limits utility, particularly for studying phenomena using the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble. Here, we present and analyze straightforward extensions of iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) that include pressure corrections during parameter optimization. Two new approaches are explored: iterative length scale rescaling (iLS) and iterative linear correction (iLC). These approaches differ from the more common practice of adding long-range attractive forces only after CG potential optimization. Performance is evaluated across diverse molecular systems, including polymer melts and molecular liquids, at varying CG resolutions. Both methods retain structural fidelity while enhancing  thermodynamic consistency through reasonable modifications of the pair potential. In particular, resulting CG models accurately reproduce radial distribution functions, densities, and density fluctuations, with iLS exhibiting improved stability and faster convergence. Analysis of isothermal compressibility reveals a general resolution-dependent trend, with significant deviation from atomistic behavior emerging below a critical CG resolution. These findings demonstrate that iLS and iLC are practical, transferable methods for constructing coarse-grained models with consistent thermodynamic behavior. They also provide insights into limits of fidelity based on the resolution of CG models.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Statistical Mechanics,2025-07-22T07:26:27.389Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information Text', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687aa316728bf9025e25ad31/original/supporting-information-text.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687a9ed5728bf9025e254fec/original/pressure-consistent-iterative-boltzmann-inversion-for-coarse-grained-molecular-dynamics.pdf

Multiple electronic states are suggested to play a significant role in the decomposition of HEMs. Therefore, exploring both ground and excited-state potential energy surfaces (PESs) describing the dissociation processes is essential for gaining mechanistic insight. 1- nitropene (NP) can be considered as a minimal model for studying the photochemistry of nitro compounds such as nitrobenzene (NB) and ortho-nitrotoluene (oNT). The photochemical pathways of trans- and cis-NP starting from the lowest bright state, have been investigated using the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method combined with second-order perturbative energy corrections (CASPT2). This involves the optimization of various stationary points and minimum energy crossing points on the PESs of relevant singlet and triplet electronic states. Our results sug- gest that both the trans and cis isomers have similar photo-decay channels except in the case of cis-NP, additional excited-state intramolecular hydrogen transfer (ESIHT) path competes with dissociation and reduces the yield of photoproducts. A total of four distinct energy transfer channels have been identified on the S 1 PES for both the trans and cis isomers of NP: (1) adiabatic pathways leading to NO 2 ( 2 B 2 ), (2) inter- system crossing to the lowest triplet state (3) internal conversion to the ground-state reactant in trans-NP or a hydrogen-transferred product in cis-NP, and (4) internal con- version resulting in dissociated photoproducts. Among the four processes, intersystem crossing has been found to be dominant, suggesting a high triplet quantum yield. The molecule on the ground state can undergo nitro-nitrite isomerization followed by the dissociation into NO and CH 3 –CH–CHO. Two different mechanisms are identified for the nitro-nitrite isomerization: one involves a roaming transition state characterized by the partially dissociated NO 2 moiety, and the other proceeds through a conventional transition state. The proposed dominant pathways and the corresponding photoproducts qualitatively explain the experimental observations in the photochemistry of NB and oNT.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.),2025-07-21T13:26:03.107Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Material', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687a06f423be8e43d6ddbe57/original/supplementary-material.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687a0420728bf9025e193882/original/ab-initio-study-of-photodissociation-and-isomerization-pathways-on-the-singlet-and-triplet-manifolds-of-1-nitropropene.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6pq6l,A Simple Correction for Semi-Empirical Electronic Structure Methods,"From the time of their introduction, there has been debate and uncertainty about the role of the atomic orbital basis in semiempirical methods. Almost invariably, an atomic orbital basis is specified (through a set of fixed parameters that might be optimized) and this basis is used to construct an overlap metric matrix which is then used to construct the Hamiltonian matrix. However, the electronic Schrodinger equation which is solved usually proceeds to assume the basis set was orthogonal (i.e., the overlap metric matrix is set to an identity in the solution of the electronic Schordinger equation). This led early on to the assertion that the parameterized Hamiltonian corresponded to a Lowdin-orthogonalized basis (as atomic-like as possible while being orthonormal). Workers have repeatedly tried to improve the behavior of semiempirical methods by explicit or implicit orthogonalization, with varying degrees of success. We take a radically different viewpoint in this work, rejecting the assertion that one has any hope to determine the basis which corresponds to the parameterized Hamiltonian. Free of the chains of this common assertion, we can exploit the uncertainty in the basis to regularize fitting of the semiempirical parameters. Specifically, we show that the accuracy of a semiempirical method can be improved by demanding that it is stationary (or as much so as possible) with respect to general linear basis transformations. This correction replicates the invariance of ab initio results with respect to such transformations and sets the stage for new strategies to fitting semiempirical Hamiltonians.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-07-21T11:16:22.351Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6879b3f9728bf9025e10c573/original/a-simple-correction-for-semi-empirical-electronic-structure-methods.pdf
