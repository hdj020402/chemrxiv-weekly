However, as AI and LLMs continue to evolve, their ability to accurately and efficiently interpret data from scientific figures and plots remains obscure. In this study, we test and evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in analyzing and extracting information from scientific figures commonly found in materials science literature, including stress-strain curves, heatmaps, 3D plots, contour plots, and other visual representations. We utilize a benchmark dataset comprising figures derived from several published works to evaluate the model's performance in quantitative material property extraction.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-64fcb-v2,Deep Learning vs Classical Methods in Potency & ADME Prediction: Insights from a Computational Blind Challenge,"Reliable prediction of compound potency and ADME profile is crucial in drug discovery.  With the recent surge of AI and deep learning frameworks, it remains unclear whether these modern techniques offer statistically significant improvement over the well-established classical methods. The 2025 ASAP-Polaris-OpenADMET Antiviral Challenge provided a unique benchmarking opportunity to address this question, joined by over 65 teams of computational scientists worldwide. Our submissions were among the top performers in terms of Pearson r correlation, ranked first in pIC50 prediction for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and fourth in aggregated ADME.  In this work, we present a retrospective analysis of our modeling strategies and highlight our lessons learned. Through rigorous statistical benchmarking, we demonstrate that while classical methods remain highly competitive for predicting potency, modern deep learning algorithms significantly outperformed traditional machine learning in ADME prediction. We also illustrate the importance of appropriate data curation and the benefits of leveraging public datasets via feature augmentation. Finally, we outline current limitations and identify future opportunities, including the integration of structure-guided modeling.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-003lg-v4,Deep Residual Learning for Molecular Force Fields,"Accurate interatomic interaction modeling via force fields is critical for biological studies and drug discovery, but balancing accuracy and generalizability remains challenging. We introduce ResFF (Residual Learning Force Field), a hybrid machine learning force field that employs deep residual learning to integrate physics-based learnable molecular mechanics covalent terms with residual corrections from a lightweight equivariant neural network. Through a three-stage joint optimization, the two components are trained in a complementary manner to achieve optimal performance. Benchmarks show ResFF outperforms classical and neural network force fields in generalization (mean absolute error (MAE): 1.16 kcal/mol on Gen2-Opt, 0.90 kcal/mol on DES370K), torsional profiles (MAE: 0.45/0.48 kcal/mol on TorsionNet-500 and Torison Scan), and intermolecular interactions (MAE: 0.32 kcal/mol on S66×8). It also enables precise energy minima reproduction and stable molecular dynamics of biological systems.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xr8r3,CurvePotGCN- A graph neural network to predict protein-protein interactions using surface curvature and electrostatic potential as node-features,"Conventional methods for predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) often depend on intricate amino
 acid-level data obtained from both sequences and structures. Although effective, such methods typically require high-definition information and considerable computational power. Here, we present CurvePotGCN, an innovative graph convolutional neural network that predicts PPIs through a simplified physicochemical model of protein
 surfaces. Our approach represents proteins as graphs wherein nodes symbolize surface clusters defined by geometric curvature and electrostatic potential, focusing exclusively on these fundamental physicochemical features rather than evolutionary conservation or complex machine learning representations. This model is built on the principle that complementary shape and electrostatic potential at the protein-protein interface are primary determinants of whether two proteins interact. CurvePotGCN achieved a predictive performance of 98% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for human PPI and 89% for yeast PPI. Upon benchmarking, CurvePotGCN showed superior performance against contemporary methods, highlighting the effectiveness of using reduced, physicochemically based models for PPI prediction.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-r7k45-v4,MTDL-GAN: De novo Design of Multi-Target Directed Ligands for Alzheimer’s Disease from Unpaired Sets of Target-Focused Chemical Library,"BACKGROUND. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, causes memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioural changes, affecting over 32 million people globally. Current AD treatments that focus on single-target intervention often fail to slow disease progression and may not be effective for all patients. Given AD's complex nature, a more effective approach may involve targeting multiple pathways simultaneously. 
METHODS. This study proposes the use of a cycle-consistent adversarial network to design multi-target directed ligands (MTDL-GAN), drugs designed to inhibit two primary AD target enzymes simultaneously; our targets of interest are acetylcholinesterase (AChE), beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3), each contributing to AD through distinct pathological mechanisms. Inhibitor libraries of the targets were curated from ChEMBL database and further characterised to represent each inhibitor domain, resulting in 69 AChE, 572 BACE1, and 246 GSK3 inhibitors. MTDL-GAN was trained on these unpaired datasets to generate MTDL-like molecules, with all generated molecular structures stored after each training step to construct large \textit{in silico} MTDL libraries. Subsequently, 300 molecules were sampled from each library to evaluate their \textit{in silico} binding affinities using molecular docking simulation. 
RESULTS. The proposed method effectively transformed molecules from the input inhibitor domains into MTDL-like molecules that exhibited dual-target binding affinity and structural novelty; several MTDLs surpassed \textit{in silico} binding affinities of investigational drugs in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials and less than 0.15\% of the generated molecules have Tanimoto similarity greater than 0.85 to the known bioactive molecules in ChEMBL and ExCAPE database.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-10-21T09:43:21.925Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f4afa85dd091524f4bd961/original/mtdl-gan-de-novo-design-of-multi-target-directed-ligands-for-alzheimer-s-disease-from-unpaired-sets-of-target-focused-chemical-library.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fx019-v2,Uncertainty Calibration in Molecular Machine Learning: Comparing Evidential and Ensemble Approaches,"Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in quantum chemistry, but their reliability hinges on uncertainty quantification (UQ). In this study, we compare two prominent UQ paradigms—Deep Evidential Regression (DER) and Deep Ensembles—on the QM9 and WS22 datasets, with a specific emphasis on the role of post hoc calibration. Raw uncertainties from both methods were systematically miscalibrated: DER produced uncertainty estimates where data noise and model uncertainty were not cleanly separated, while ensembles produced sharper yet underconfident estimates. Applying calibration techniques such as isotonic regression, standard scaling, and GP-Normal corrected these deficiencies, aligning predicted variances with observed errors. On QM9, calibration enabled DER to filter high-confidence predictions more effectively than ensembles. On WS22, calibrated ensembles not only improved statistical reliability but also delivered substantial computational savings in active learning, reducing redundant ab initio evaluations by more than 20%. These results demonstrate that post hoc calibration is essential to transform uncertainty estimates from descriptive metrics into actionable signals, ensuring both trustworthy predictions and resource-efficient molecular modeling.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-10-21T08:50:30.505Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f1fb39bc2ac3a0e0805ba3/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f1fb38bc2ac3a0e0805b98/original/uncertainty-calibration-in-molecular-machine-learning-comparing-evidential-and-ensemble-approaches.pdf

While significant progress has been made in automating individual steps, the development of a complete predictive model remains a human-intensive effort to orchestrate existing software tools and revise models. This Perspective outlines a practical path to improved chemical kinetic model development using agentic AI. A dual-lane architecture is introduced: a fast execution lane handles mechanism generation and parameter refinement, while a deliberative agentic lane plans, refines, and revises while executing experiments and computations. The proposed outcome is a robust pathway toward decision-grade models. Humans remain central: researchers set objectives and priors, approve high-impact actions, and adjudicate new chemical insights. Creativity, complex judgment, and strategic thinking remain in the human domain.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xrj23,Vacancy-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Predicting Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity in High-Entropy Layered Double Hydroxides,"The progress of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for sustainable energy technologies, and high-entropy layered double hydroxides (HE-LDHs) appear to be a great candidate to address this issue. Nonetheless, understanding how the interplay of compositional variety, vacancy engineering, and catalytic activity works together is challenging, as it does not lend itself to conventional machine learning approaches. Therefore, we develop a vacancy-aware graph neural network (VA-GNN) that captures complex material–property relationships exhibited in HE-LDH systems. The model adopts a multi-descriptor framework that contains vacancy-related descriptors and models materials as graphs in which nodes represent metallic elements and a surface-specific node. Material representations include vacancy embeddings in the node and edge descriptors to capture both local and cooperativity between vacancies and the parent metal framework. Ultimately, VA-GNN is trained using a synthetically generated dataset of HE-LDHs and demonstrates better performance than conventional machine learning benchmarks in predicting important OER performance metrics. Additionally, ablation studies and qualitative analyses confirm the importance of vacancy encoding and the surface-specific node representation. This work showcases VA-GNN's potential to accelerate the discovery and design of efficient HE-LDH catalysts using interpretable, vacancy-aware models.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-10-24T20:04:05.952Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f93c595dd091524fdae0c4/original/vacancy-aware-graph-neural-networks-for-predicting-oxygen-evolution-reaction-activity-in-high-entropy-layered-double-hydroxides.pdf

Despite extensive research, one of the key factors hindering their broader deployment is the absence of reproducible and scalable synthetic protocols. To address this, we introduce FAIR-MOFs, a database designed to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), comprising 45{,}700 curated experimental structures, 33{,}361 geometry-optimised structures, and 4{,}161 entries linked to reported synthesis conditions. Analysis of the dataset showed that the propensity of open-metal sites in MOFs is statistically associated with reaction temperature, metal salts, ligands, topology, and metal secondary building unit. Furthermore, we developed a retrosynthetic recommender that captures literature co-usage patterns among solvents, metal salts, and ligands. For any given component, the system suggests compatible reagents and retrieves MOFs prepared under similar conditions. Finally, we trained a graph-based neural network integrated with our MOF deconstruction module to predict most probable metal salts, ligands and solvents directly from 3D structures of experimental or hypothetical MOFs. Using this model, we successfully synthesised MOFs randomly selected from hypothetical MOF databases illustrating the potential of FAIR-MOFs to accelerate the discovery and enable data-driven synthesis of MOFs.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Hydrogen Storage Materials; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Materials Chemistry,2025-10-24T15:21:12.996Z,"[{'title': 'Electronic Supporting Information ', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e0285e5dd091524fc2d897/original/electronic-supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68dff580dfd0d042d1d9e0ba/original/fair-mo-fs-a-comprehensive-database-for-accelerating-the-discovery-and-synthesis-of-metal-organic-frameworks.pdf

Continuous progress in this field requires reliable reference datasets, accurate MLFF architectures, and efficient active learning strategies to enable robust modeling of complex molecular and material systems. Here we introduce AIMS - PAX, an expedited, multi-trajectory active learning framework that streamlines the development of stable and accurate MLFFs. Designed for a wide range of researchers, AIMS -PAX offers a modular, high-performance workflow that couples diversified sampling with scalable training across CPU and GPU architectures. Integrated with the widely used ab initio code FHI- AIMS, the framework supports state-of-the-art ML models and dataset generation using general- purpose (or ""foundational"") force-fields for rapid deployment in diverse systems. We demonstrate the capabilities of AIMS -PAX in various challenging tasks: creating datasets and models for highly flexible peptides, multiple organic molecules at once, explicitly solvated molecules, and for efficiently handling computationally demanding systems such as the CsPbI3 perovskite. We show that AIMS -PAX achieves a reduction of up to three orders of magnitude in the number of required reference calculations, automatically selects challenging systems within a given chemical space, facilitates simulation of solvated molecules with more than thousand atoms, while enabling a ten-fold speedup in active- learning time through optimized resource utilization.

Here, we present an ML-based screening framework for identifying optimal organic photosensitizers (OPSs), which leverages domain-adaptation-based transfer learning (TL) to enhance surrogate-model performance. Even when applied to photoreactions that are more complex than those in the source domain, such as a reaction involving an intricate radical-chain mechanism or a three-component reaction, the TL-based system outperforms conventional ML-based optimization methods that do not utilize TL. These results highlight the feasibility of using chemically rational TL that enables the transfer of knowledge from simple reactions to those where mechanistic understanding or database construction is more difficult. Moreover, the proposed approach performs reliably no matter how the initial samples are selected, and it is effective in identifying a highly active OPS that is missing from the source domain, thereby addressing critical limitations of current ML-based approaches in organic synthesis.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Machine Learning; Homogeneous Catalysis; Photocatalysis,2025-10-24T07:26:46.736Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f833b8aec32c65685c8e25/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f8258c5dd091524fb9097e/original/machine-learning-guided-screening-of-organic-photosensitizers-accelerated-by-domain-adaptation.pdf

Until recently this remained an unaddressed problem in asymmetric catalysis under data-limited scenarios, yet it now appears possible to be supported with the aid of AI-based models. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework trained on small, well-curated experimental datasets to predict enantiomeric excess (ee) in catalytic asymmetric reactions. Applied to two magnesium-catalyzed benchmarks: chalcone epoxidation and thia-Michael addition, selected models reproduced experimental enantioselectivities with high fidelity (R2 up to ~0.8), and successfully generalized to previously untested substrates, as confirmed by experimental validation.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ggp8n-v4,How to build machine learning models able to extrapolate from standard to modified peptides,"Bioactive peptides are an important class of natural products with great functional versatility. Chemical modifications can improve their pharmacology, yet their structural diversity presents unique challenges for computational modeling. Furthermore, data for standard peptides (composed of the 20 canonical amino acids) is more abundant than for modified ones. Thus, we set out to identify whether predictive models fitted to standard data are reliable when applied to modified peptides. To do this, we first considered two critical aspects of the modeling problem, namely, choice of similarity function for guiding dataset partitioning and choice of molecular representation. Similarity-based dataset partitioning is an evaluation technique that divides the dataset into train and test subsets, such that the molecules in the test set are different from those used to fit the model.  

Scientific contribution. We demonstrate, across four peptide function prediction tasks, that chemical fingerprint-based similarity measures outperform traditional sequence alignment-based metrics for partitioning standard peptide datasets, challenging conventional practice. We have also found that the choice of representation does not have a substantial impact in the standard to standard interpolation modelling scenario, but for modified to modified interpolation chemical language models are the best option. Despite a 50\% drop in performance, chemical fingerprints and a chemical language model (ChemBERTa-2) are the best choices in the more challenging extrapolation scenario (standard to modified). All code and data necessary for reproducing the experiments are available in Github (https://github.com/IBM/PeptideGeneralizationBenchmarks).",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-10-23T09:17:41.471Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f749043e6156d3be1c29e5/original/how-to-build-machine-learning-models-able-to-extrapolate-from-standard-to-modified-peptides.pdf

To address this, we present FEP Ω, a novel ML-native platform for FEP that directly resolves these limitations and accelerates deployment. FEP Ω flips the traditional paradigm of free energy perturbation on its head by eliminating a priori force field adjustments, alchemical intermediates, and network corrections. Instead, FEP Ω uses a standardized and automated setup protocol while leveraging machine learning post-simulation to achieve unprecedented, data-driven accuracy in a streamlined workflow. Together, these innovations make FEP lighter, faster, more accurate, and immediately practical for hit-to-lead and lead optimization.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xn5zb-v3,DeepFit: physically and chemically informed XAS-Structure fitting made simple,"Whilst X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy is a valuable tool to unravel local atomic and electronic structure of catalysts' active sites under working conditions, its quantitative analysis is a complex ill-posed problem. Main limitations of currently existing methods for XANES quantitative analysis are (1) high demand of computational resources needed, (2) lack of universality of ML models between absorption edges, (3) absence of chemical and physical constraints, (4) low specificity for real catalytical cases. To address them simultaniously in an unified framework we introduce the DeepFit, a deep learning approach for physically and chemically informed on-the-fly XANES spectra analysis. By constructing the tmXAS—a comprehensive database of 67,000 possible local atomic environments and their corresponding Ab-initio K-edge XAS spectra for all 3d and 4d transition metals—we leverage a state-of-the-art universal deep learning model for rapid spectral prediction. This approach incorporates physical constraints through equivariance, ensuring consistency with fundamental symmetries. Then, combining quantum chemistry and DeepFit neural network differentiation, we implement an approach for chemically informed atomic structure refinement, capable of $3D$ structure prediction considering both spectroscopic and energetic favorability. Domain-specific spectroscopic solutions were put in the tmXAS database and DeepFit approach to better work with often overlooked in analysis methods and highly relevant cases of homogeneous and single-site/single-atom catalysts. The method's validity for both structure refinement and spectra prediction is rigorously demonstrated with several benchmarks, including structure unraveling of the Rh-complex homogeneous hydroformylation catalyst and well-defined 3d/4d metal coordination compounds (Cu, Co, Zn, Ni), where quantitative agreement with single-crystal XRD and EXAFS is met.

However, conventional density functional theory often falls short, as exemplified by the “CO adsorption puzzle.” Here, we demonstrate that the hybrid PBE-D3/M06 method overcomes these limitations, achieving near-chemical accuracy for C-species on Cu(100), Cu(110), and Cu(111) surfaces. This approach resolves the CO puzzle by correctly predicting adsorption sites and energies in excellent agreement with experimental data. The method yields remarkably low mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.06 eV for reaction intermediates (vs. RPA calculations) and 0.04 eV for molecules (vs. experimental values). To accelerate these high-fidelity calculations, we further developed a machine learning model that rapidly predicts accurate adsorption energies (MAE: 0.08 eV) from standard PBE values.

The predictor model affords high accuracy with mean absolute errors of ca. 0.2 eV and is uniquely able to generalise to previously unseen solvents. We couple this architecture with an evolutionary algorithm to inverse-design synthetically accessible candidate molecules with target reduction potentials for several battery-related practical applications.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning,2025-10-21T09:05:00.210Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f2619f5dd091524f0de4c6/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f2619f5dd091524f0de4af/original/multi-solvent-graph-neural-network-for-reduction-potential-prediction-across-the-chemical-space.pdf
