10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-003lg-v2,Deep Residual Learning for Molecular Force Fields,"Accurate interatomic interaction modeling via force fields is critical for biological studies and drug discovery, but balancing accuracy and generalizability remains challenging. We introduce ResFF, a hybrid machine learning force field that employs deep residual learning to integrate explicit physics-based bonded terms with residual corrections from a lightweight equivariant neural network. Through a three-stage joint optimization, ResFF decomposes molecular energy into dominant bonded contributions and complex noncovalent deviations. Benchmarks show ResFF outperforms classical and neural network force fields in generalization (mean absolute error (MAE): 1.16 kcal/mol on Gen2-Opt, 0.90 kcal/mol on DES370K), torsional profiles (MAE: 0.45/0.48 kcal/mol on TorsionNet-500/Scan), and intermolecular interactions (MAE: 0.32 kcal/mol on S66×8). It also enables precise energy minima reproduction and stable molecular dynamics of biological systems. ResFF merges physical constraints with neural expressiveness, offering a robust tool for accurate and efficient molecular simulation.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-07-18T19:47:04.737Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information of ResFF', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68784b00728bf9025ed10ac2/original/supporting-information-of-res-ff.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68784b00728bf9025ed10aaf/original/deep-residual-learning-for-molecular-force-fields.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jpp14,LLM-Guided Ligand Design for Controlling Nanoscopic Morphology of CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals,"Traditional nanocrystal ligand design often relies on trial-and-error, limiting systematic exploration. Here, we present a framework integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) agent into experimental planning, iteratively refining ligand design for nanocrystal synthesis. Through structured human-AI dialogue, we generated testable hypotheses and uncovered key design principles: planar aromatics promote anisotropic growth via π-stacking, while steric hindrance and chirality influence surface coverage and introduce directional biases. This iterative human-AI approach led to selecting (R)- and (S)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylammonium (R/S-NEA) as promising ligand candidates.
High-throughput experiments on CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystal growth revealed striking enantiomer-specific effects. S-NEA enhanced photoluminescence and yielded larger morphologies with increasing concentrations, while R-NEA promoted anisotropic growth with increased lattice strain. Density Functional Theory provided mechanistic insight: R-NEA preferentially binds CsPbBr3 (110) surfaces, while S-NEA shows enhanced stability on (100) and (111) facets. These findings demonstrate how ligand aromaticity and stereochemistry induce facet-specific binding and shape control. This study establishes a systematic, iterative framework for AI-assisted materials design, validating LLM-predicted structure-property relationships and offering a scalable methodology for accelerating discovery across diverse material systems through continuous refinement.

discovery: application to catalysts for the HER
and ORR","The extraordinary progress of strategies coupling ab initio calculations and machine learning (ML) has opened the door for both fast and accurate chemical/physical properties predictions and for the virtual design of materials. However, these techniques are very often used as a ""black box"" with the sole objective of obtaining high accuracy with scarce or no special attention on how ML models obtain their predictions.  This can be improved by leveraging explainability of ML models, which, at the same time, would increase the chance of ML to offer new insights into the chemistry and physics of materials. Hence, the next generation of ML models in these realms must guarantee explainability by embedding explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools into their pipelines. Specifically, ML-assisted materials discovery and design can take great advantage of the use of XAI. Enabling explanations would increase the impact of these approaches by providing not only a set of candidates, but also insights into what makes a given material better than others. With this in mind, on the example of heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrogen production and energy generation, here we propose a novel strategy for materials design based on counterfactuals explanations. We were able to find materials featuring properties close to the design targets that were later validated with density functional theory calculations. Explanations were devised by comparing original samples, counterfactuals, and discovered candidates. Such explanations allowed us to unveil subtle relationships between the most relevant features, other, in principle, less important features, and the target property.  This work provides an alternative to already available designing strategies, such as high-throughput screening or generative models, but that, for the first time, incorporates explainability as its main driving mechanism.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence,2025-07-17T05:53:41.105Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687666a623be8e43d656a113/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6876617523be8e43d6556edc/original/explainable-artificial-intelligence-for-materials-discovery-application-to-catalysts-for-the-her-and-orr.pdf

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-93xmj,Highly Accurate and Fast Prediction of MOF Free Energy Via Machine Learning,"A major bottleneck in translating computational screening of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to laboratory synthesis is the uncertain synthetic accessibility of computer-generated MOF designs. While MOF free energy calculations are emerging as a way to anticipate synthetic accessibility, the computational cost of traditional molecular simulation methods remains incompatible with the immense MOF design space, which spans trillions of structures. Here we propose and demonstrate the efficient prediction of this important quantity using machine learning. Our approach is based on three ingredients: (1) a newly curated dataset of nearly 1 million MOFs and their properties, including measured free energies for a subset of these structures; (2) a novel sequence representation of MOFs, called MOFSeq, that incorporates both local and global MOF features; and (3) a large language model (LLM-Prop) pre-trained on strain energy prediction and then fine-tuned on free energy prediction using MOFSeq. Our trained model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.789 kJ/mol on free energy prediction. Remarkably, this same model, without retraining, demonstrated exceptional versatility by predicting MOF synthesizability with a 97% F1 score. Furthermore, it correctly selected the right MOF polymorph with an average accuracy of 78.1%, with this accuracy increasing to 100% for free energy differences greater than 4.05 kJ/mol and remaining above 60% even when the free energy difference was as low as 0.16 kJ/mol.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-07-14T12:58:10.587Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686fedbc43bc52e4ec4edfc6/original/highly-accurate-and-fast-prediction-of-mof-free-energy-via-machine-learning.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-7csf2,Accelerating the Discovery of High-Conductivity Glass Electrolytes via Machine Learning,"Glass materials are promising candidates as solid electrolytes for batteries. However, the atomistic origins of variations in ionic conductivity with composition remain poorly understood. A key challenge in computationally designing high-performance glass electrolytes is the absence of an efficient general interatomic potential, particularly for mixed-anion systems, such as combinations of oxides, sulphides, and halides. To address these limitations, a machine learning interatomic potential for glass electrolytes is introduced, based on the atomic cluster expansion descriptor, covering common network formers, modifiers, and anions. Excellent agreement with experimental structure and property data across a wide range of glass compositions is observed. While the potential is broadly applicable to, e.g., lithium-ion conductivity, focus is here on the influence of glass composition on sodium-ion conductivity given the emerging importance of these conductors. By screening the diffusivity of 1,303 glass compositions, the presence of anion species, such as sulphides and halides, is found to have a large positive influence on diffusivity, enabling prediction of highly conductive glasses with mixed anions. Diffusivity and ionic conductivity are highly correlated with a set of descriptors, such as the average atomic volume. This work thus helps to accelerate predictive modelling and broader understanding of conductivity in glass electrolytes.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry,2025-07-14T11:04:22.330Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686fa9e4e1957b8c6122866b/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686fa7a443bc52e4ec366d6c/original/accelerating-the-discovery-of-high-conductivity-glass-electrolytes-via-machine-learning.pdf

To address these challenges, we introduced conformal selection as an enhanced approach to optimize the compound screening process with balanced risks and benefits. Leveraging conformal inference, our approach constructs p-values for each candidate molecule to quantify statistical evidence for selection. The final selection of molecules is determined by comparing these p-values against thresholds derived from multiple testing principles. Our approach offers rigorous control over the false discovery/omission rate, ensuring validity independent of dataset size and requiring minimal assumptions. By avoiding the estimation of prediction errors required in previous approaches, our method achieves higher accuracy (power), thereby improving the ability to identify promising candidates. We validate these advantages through numerical simulations on real-world datasets.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence,2025-07-14T08:06:03.702Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Materials for ""Conformal Selection for Efficient and Accurate Compound Screening in Drug Discovery""', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687024ed728bf9025ed8662d/original/supporting-materials-for-conformal-selection-for-efficient-and-accurate-compound-screening-in-drug-discovery.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687023e2728bf9025ed7e48b/original/conformal-selection-for-efficient-and-accurate-compound-screening-in-drug-discovery.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-dvrzs-v2,Machine Learning Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Properties Influencing Drug Solubility,"Solubility is critical in drug discovery and development, as it significantly influences a medication's bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Understanding solubility at the early stages of drug discovery is essential for minimizing resource consumption and enhancing the likelihood of clinical success via prioritizing compounds with optimal solubility. Mo-lecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful computational tool for modeling various physicochemical properties, particularly solubility. MD simulations offer a detailed perspective on molecular interactions and dynamics, providing insights into the factors influencing solubility. This study aims to statistically examine the impact of ten MD-derived properties, along with logP, one of the most influential experimental properties, on the aqueous solubility of drugs us-ing Machine Learning (ML) techniques. To achieve this, a dataset comprising 211 drugs from diverse classes was com-piled from the literature. These drugs were subjected to MD simulation, from which relevant properties were extracted and selected as features. Additionally, the corresponding octanol-water partition coefficient (logP) from previous studies was incorporated into the analysis. Through rigorous analysis, the properties with the most significant influence on sol-ubility were identified and subsequently used as input features for four ensemble machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting. The results indicate that seven properties, logP, Solvent Accessi-ble Surface Area (SASA), Coulombic_t, LJ, Estimated Solvation Free energies (DGSolv), RMSD, and Average number of solvents in Solvation Shell (AVGshell) are highly effective in predicting solubility, exhibiting performance compara-ble to predictive models based on structural features. The Gradient Boosting algorithm achieved the best performance with a predictive R2 of 0.87 and an RMSE of 0.537 in test set. This research underscores the potential of integrating MD simulations with ML methodologies to improve the accuracy and efficiency of aqueous solubility predictions in drug development.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-cvk0n,Investigation of the Effect of Framework Flexibility on CO2 Adsorption in SIFSIX-3-Cu using a Machine Learned Force Field,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer promise as selective CO2 sorbents, but successful MOF sorbent materials need high CO2 binding affinity and selectivity for CO2 over water. This work focuses on the use of machine learned force fields (MLFFs) to model CO₂ adsorption in flexible MOFs, with a focus on SIFSIX-3-Cu, an anion-pillared MOF known for its high CO2 affinity. A preliminary high-throughput screening of over 900 anion-pillared MOFs was performed using rigid UFF+DDEC6 force fields to predict zero-loading heats of adsorption for CO2 and H2O. SIFSIX-3-Cu was selected for further computational study due to its predicted CO2 heat of adsorption and experimental relevance. A DeePMD-based MLFF was trained to reproduce DFT (PBE+D3) energies and forces, with an iterative sampling scheme combining molecular dynamics, geometry optimization, random geometric insertion and NVT Monte Carlo-based configuration generation to capture both attractive and repulsive regions of the potential energy surface. Flexibility of the MOF was explicitly included, contrasting with previous models approximating the MOF as rigid. Hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations with the MLFF produced CO2 adsorption isotherms in good agreement with experimental data at direct air capture (DAC) pressures (e.g., 40 Pa), in contrast to previous overestimations of CO2 sorption by models with rigid structures. Bond and angle histogram analysis showed that MOF flexibility increased the variance of fluorine-fluorine diagonal distances at adsorption sites, resulting in a lower predicted sorption for flexible, asymmetric SIFSIX-3-Cu pore geometries as compared to the rigid, symmetric DFT-optimized SIFSIX-3-Cu pore geometry. A detailed description of flexibility afforded by the MLFF resulted in an accurately predicted CO2 uptake (1.05 mmol/g) at low pressure (40 Pa) compared to the experimentally measured value (1.24 mmol/g). These results underscore the importance of including framework flexibility when modeling adsorption phenomena in MOFs, particularly for low pressure applications.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-07-18T20:19:45.412Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information for Investigation of the Effect of Framework Flexibility on CO2 Adsorption in SIFSIX-3-Cu using a Machine Learned Force Field', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68784984fc5f0acb52962c00/original/supporting-information-for-investigation-of-the-effect-of-framework-flexibility-on-co2-adsorption-in-sifsix-3-cu-using-a-machine-learned-force-field.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687845fa23be8e43d694b134/original/investigation-of-the-effect-of-framework-flexibility-on-co2-adsorption-in-sifsix-3-cu-using-a-machine-learned-force-field.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-sr2np,Effect of Shear Flow and Precursor Polymer Design on Single-Chain Nanoparticle Formation,"Single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) are a class of materials formed by the intramolecular cross-linking and collapse of single polymer chains. Because their morphology dictates suitability for specific applications, such as nanoscale reactors and drug delivery vehicles, understanding how to control or tailor morphologies is of interest. Here, we investigate how the morphology of SCNPs depends on both precursor chain attributes, such as linker fraction and backbone stiffness, and an imposed shear flow. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we generate an ensemble of structures from 10,800 unique SCNPs, some formed  under quiescent conditions and some in shear flow--the latter of which has not been previously studied. We then characterize morphologies by analysis of a three-dimensional embedding space obtained through unsupervised learning of the simulated structures. This reveals how SCNP morphology depends on dimensionless parameters, related to precursor-chain attributes and shear rate, and offers insight into their relative influence. Interestingly, we find that shear rate has comparable influence to the degree of polymerization and the blockiness of reactive sites. Furthermore, shear, which can be externally controlled independent of precursor chain synthesis, can have persistent effects on morphology, such as enhancing compaction of SCNPs based on stiff chains. This work provides guidelines for designing SCNPs with targeted characteristics based on five dimensionless variables and illustrates the utility of machine learning in analyzing SCNPs formed across a range of conditions.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Polymer morphology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning,2025-07-18T19:52:32.820Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information Text', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68785bc523be8e43d696ff2c/original/supplementary-information-text.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6877c73e23be8e43d6840e82/original/effect-of-shear-flow-and-precursor-polymer-design-on-single-chain-nanoparticle-formation.pdf

One key bottleneck in the development of biodegradable polyesters is the slow nature of biodegradability testing, which can often take weeks to months. High-throughput screening assays serve as a rapid tool to determine the biodegradability of materials quickly, without the need for lengthy, expensive testing. When combined with machine learning, the data generated by high-throughput assays can be exploited to predict the properties of other similar materials. Here, we report the development of a high-throughput enzymatic biodegradation assay, which has been used to determine the biodegradability of 48 polyesters. Using data generated from the assay to train a predictive model, we can predict the biodegradability of polyesters using an explainable random forest model with 71 % accuracy.

Here, we develop a robust computational framework that integrates realistic preparation and reaction conditions to effectively track the formation of active sites and decipher structure- activity relationships. Using syngas conversion over the ZnxCryOz system as a demonstration, we identified that the system preferentially segregates into ZnO and ZnCr2O4 phases with ZnO forming a monolayer on ZnCr2O4 surfaces as the active phase, under preparation conditions. Under reaction conditions, by deploying CH-O bond dissociation as a descriptor, we found the ZnO/ZnCr2O4(100) surface is the active surface. Crucially, we pinpoint geometrically linked oxygen vacancy pairs as the true active sites. Full microkinetic analyses conducted on these active sites yield kinetic results that align well with experimental observations.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-n9gpr,Enhanced Thermophysical Property Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification using Group Contribution- Gaussian Process Regression,"Group contribution (GC) models are powerful, simple, and popular methods for property prediction. However, the most accessible and computationally efficient GC methods, like the Joback and Reid (JR) GC models, often exhibit severe systematic bias. Furthermore, most GC methods do not have uncertainty estimates associated with their predictions. The present work develops a hybrid method for property prediction that integrates GC models with Gaussian process (GP) regression. Predictions from the JR GC method, along with the molecular weight, are used as input features to a GP model, which learns and corrects the systematic bias in the GC predictions, resulting in highly accurate property predictions with reliable uncertainty estimates. The method was applied to six properties; normal boiling temperature (Tb), enthalpy of vaporization at Tb (∆Hvap), normal melting temperature (Tm), critical pressure (Pc), critical molar volume (Vc), and critical temperature (Tc). The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics was used as the source of experimental data. The final collected experimental data ranged from 485 molecules for ∆Hvap to 5640 for Tm. The proposed GCGP method was found to provide much improved property prediction accuracy compared to the GC-only method. The coefficient of determination (R2) values of the testing set predictions are ≥ 0.85 for five out of six and ≥ 0.90 for four out of six properties modeled, and compare favorably with other methods in the literature.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-9mggj,ChemTorch: A Deep Learning Framework for Benchmarking and Developing Chemical Reaction Property Prediction Models,"The accurate prediction of chemical reaction properties, such as yields and activation energies, is fundamental to chemical synthesis and industrial process optimization. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, achieving accuracies comparable to traditional quantum mechanical methods at a fraction of the computational cost. Models tackling different tasks, from reaction outcome prediction to retrosynthesis, have been developed, leveraging different representations like molecular graphs or text-based notations. However, this progress has led to a fragmented ecosystem of specialized, incompatible codebases. The lack of a unified framework and standardized evaluation protocols makes it difficult to compare methods fairly, limits the development of new approaches, and hinders the assessment of the true real-world performance of models. Here, we introduce ChemTorch, a modular open-source framework designed to unify and streamline the development and benchmarking of deep learning models for chemical reactions. Using ChemTorch, we conduct a systematic study on reaction barrier height prediction and demonstrate how common but unrealistic benchmarking practices, such as providing ground-truth atom-to-atom mappings or 3D geometries at test time, lead to overly optimistic performance estimates. By re-evaluating models in a setting that withholds such privileged information, we reveal significant performance drops that better reflect the challenges of real-world deployment. We therefore propose a new set of benchmarking guidelines that promote end-to-end evaluation, where models must operate on readily available 2D chemical structures without relying on computationally expensive data. ChemTorch provides the community with a powerful tool to accelerate research and promote reproducibility, and by adopting these more rigorous evaluation standards, the field can shift its focus towards developing models that are not only accurate in benchmarks but are genuinely applicable in practice.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-07-16T10:25:09.991Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687556a4fc5f0acb52358b65/original/chem-torch-a-deep-learning-framework-for-benchmarking-and-developing-chemical-reaction-property-prediction-models.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-szt8q-v3,Bridging the Gap: Using Machine Learning Force Fields to Simulate Gold Break Junctions at Pulling Speeds Closer to Experiments,"The properties and dynamics of gold nanowires have been studied for decades as an important testbed for several physical phenomena. Gold nanowires forming at contacts are an integral part of molecular junctions used to study the electronic and thermal properties of single molecules. However, the huge discrepancy in timescales between experiments and simulations, compounded by the limited accuracy of classical force fields, has posed a challenge in accurately simulating realistic junctions. Here we show that machine-learning force fields reveal new behaviors not captured by classical force fields when modeling Au-Au pulling junctions. Our simulations show a dependency of the average breaking distance on the pulling speed, highlighting a more complex behavior than previously thought. Our results demonstrate that the use of more accurate force fields to simulate metallic nanowires is essential to capture the complexity of their structural evolution in break junction experiments. Our developments advance the modeling accuracy of molecular junctions, bridging the gap between experimental and simulation timescales.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bdlqm-v2,Model Driven Adaptive Design with Concentration Profiles,"Effective kinetic models of heterogeneous catalytic processes are an indispensable tool for reactor design, optimization and control. Under the assumption of using functional forms like power laws, model parameters are traditionally fitted to kinetic data measured along local line scans, by systematically changing individual reaction parameters like a reactant concentration or temperature. This approach typically involves numerous separate kinetic measurements, and is susceptible to the uncertainty of these line scans in determining the model’s parameters. Here we explore the use of profile reactors in combination with a fully automated adaptive design approach for an efficient identification of effective kinetic models. Originally developed to provide operando information along the axis of tubular reactors, profile reactors provide a complex line scan that encapsulates kinetic information across all reaction conditions probed along the tube. The proposed Model- Driven Adaptive Design with Profiles (MDAP) algorithm harnesses this extensive dataset to strategically guide the selection of initial reaction conditions for subsequent profile reactor measurements. This approach ensures that each line scan provides maximally complementary information, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of kinetic model identification.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Heterogeneous Catalysis,2025-07-16T06:56:10.092Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6874eb2dfc5f0acb52289e30/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6874eb2dfc5f0acb52289e23/original/model-driven-adaptive-design-with-concentration-profiles.pdf

However, building scalable and robust models for molecular property prediction remains a significant challenge due to the vast size and complexity of chemical space. In this paper, we introduce ChemBERTa-3, an open-source training framework designed to train and fine-tune large-scale chemical foundation models. We explore the potential of multiple model architectures by evaluating their performance across various molecular datasets from the MoleculeNet suite. Our experiments demonstrated that pre-training on the expansive ZINC20 dataset yields models capable of performing well on both classification and regression tasks, providing valuable insights into drug discovery and materials science.

Despite this, representations of orbitals in deep learning models have been very underdeveloped relative to representations of molecular geometries and Hamiltonians. Here, we apply state-of-the-art equivariant deep learning architectures to the task of assigning global labels to orbitals, namely energies characterizations, given the molecular coefficients from Hartree-Fock or density functional theory. The architecture we have developed, the Cartesian Equivariant Orbital Network (CEONet), shows how molecular orbital coefficients are readily featurized as equivariant node features common to all graph-based machine learned potentials. We find that CEONet performs well at predicting difficult quantitative labels such as the orbital energy and orbital entropy. Furthermore, we find that the CEONet representation provides an intuitive latent space for differentiating orbital character for the qualitative assignment of e.g. bonding or antibonding character. In addition to providing a useful representation for further integrating deep learning with electronic structure theory, we expect CEONet to be useful for automatizing and interpreting the results of advanced electronic structure methods such as complete active space self-consistent field theory. In particular, the ability of CEONet to infer multireference character via the orbital entropy paves the way towards the machine-learned selection of active spaces.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-07-15T07:04:59.544Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68716b8843bc52e4ec80ea67/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68716b8843bc52e4ec80ea59/original/cartesian-equivariant-representations-for-learning-and-understanding-molecular-orbitals.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-5f868,SynCat: A light weight graph neural network model to classify chemical reactions,"Chemical reactions typically follow mechanistic templates and hence fall into a manageable number of clearly distinguishable classes that usually labeled by names of chemists who discovered or explored them. These ``named reactions'' form the core of reaction ontologies and are associated with specific synthetic procedures.  Classification of chemical reactions, therefore, is an essential step for the construction and maintenance of reaction-template databases, in particular for the purpose of synthetic route planning. Large-scale reaction databases, however, typically do not annotate named reactions systematically. Although many methods have been proposed, most are sensitive to reagent variations and do not guarantee permutation invariance. Here, we propose SynCat, a graph‐based framework that leverages molecule‐level cross‐attention to perform precise reagent detection and role assignment, eliminating unwanted species. SynCat ensures permutation invariance by employing a pairwise summation of participant embeddings. This method balances mechanistic specificity derived from individual-molecule embeddings with the order-independent nature of the pairwise representation. Across multiple benchmark datasets, SynCat outperformed established reaction fingerprints DRFP and RXNFP, achieving a mean classification accuracy of 0.988, together with enhanced scalability.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-07-14T16:20:20.890Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6874ccf6fc5f0acb522535e8/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686e846a728bf9025e9101c8/original/syn-cat-a-light-weight-graph-neural-network-model-to-classify-chemical-reactions.pdf

Absorption in Organic Dyes","Entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA) offers promising advantages for quantum
spectroscopy due to its linear dependence on photon flux and reduced photodamage.
However, experimental limitations in distinguishing ETPA from competing one-photon
processes have hindered broader applications. Here, we present a predictive computational
framework based on time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) that
elucidates the fundamental mechanisms controling ETPA in organic chromophores. Using
rhodamine 6G (R6G) and zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) as model systems,
our simulations reveal that nondegenerate photon pairs significantly enhance ETPA intensity
when one of the photon energies approaches resonance with one-photon absorption
(OPA) transitions-a finding with important implications for experimental design.
Despite a systematic blue-shift ( 0.5 eV) typical of TD-DFT calculations, our results
accurately predict spectral trends across energy ranges broader than those that can be
experimentally accessed by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Potentially, the
presented computational ETPA calculations are able to provide critical guidance for
experimental studies by narrowing the exploration space for nonlinear crystal selection

Extensive studies have been performed on the thermal and photochemical interconversions between benzene and its valence isomers. In this article, we show that mechanochemical pulling along 1,2- positions of triprismane (TP) can precisely control the outcome namely, benzene (BZ) and/or Dewar benzene (DB) depending upon strength of external force. Within the force range of 1.5 – 1.9 nN, DB is formed exclusively, whereas at forces exceeding ≥ 2.0 nN, BZ becomes the major product. Also, we report that pulling across 1,4- sites of TP, BZ is produced exclusively when external force ≥ 1.8 nN. Ab-initio steered molecular dynamics (AISMD) simulations on the force modified potential energy surfaces (FMPES) for 1,2-pulling of TP reveal that DB becomes the minor product beyond external force ≥ 2.0 nN. The thermodynamically controlled product, BZ is obtained as the major and sole product for stronger 1,2-pulling and 1,4-pulling respectively. The constrained geometries simulate external force (CoGEF) calculations fail to locate the kinetically trapped intermediate, DB revealing the prowess of AISMD in revealing unique intermediates and fleetingly stable products in the course of mechanochemical reactions.

The increasingly popular curvature-driven schemes represent a subset of TSH based on implicit local diabatization of potential energy surfaces. Their appeal partly stems from compatibility with machine-learning frameworks that often provide only local PES information. Here, we critically assess the limitations of these curvature-based algorithms by examining three challenging scenarios: (i) dynamics involving more than two strongly coupled electronic states; (ii) trivial crossings; and (iii) spurious transitions arising from small discontinuities in multireference potential energy surfaces. Furthermore, we extend the Landau–Zener Surface Hopping (LZSH) method beyond two-state systems and introduce practical modifications to enhance its robustness. The performance is benchmarked on both low- and higherdimensional model Hamiltonians, as well as realistic molecular systems treated with ab initio methods. While curvature-driven TSH using the explicit electronic coefficient propagation qualitatively captures the dynamics in most cases, we find no regime where it outperforms LZSH, especially when trivial crossings, multistate crossings, or 1 discontinuities are encountered. Hence, we advocate for using a conceptually simple but solid LZSH method when nonadiabatic couplings are not available.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.),2025-07-17T08:16:15.309Z,"[{'title': 'Si for the manuscript', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/687771d2fc5f0acb52794faf/original/si-for-the-manuscript.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68761876728bf9025e8a3679/original/critical-assessment-of-curvature-driven-surface-hopping-algorithms.pdf

Additionally, GAMA employs an ONIOM-style multilevel framework to capture long-range interactions.

Three formulations are explored, based off the popular double-hybrid functionals B2PLYP, DSD-PBEP86 and PBEQIDH. Partial use of the PA23 proton binding affinities dataset is made to parameterize the ratio in the DFT:MP2 correlation energies. The resulting models are evaluated on a separate set of titratable molecules. The combination of NEO-DFT and NEO-MP2 electron-proton correlation leads up to a two-fold reduction in the RMSD compared to standard NEO-DFT, a trend that is confirmed in the independent test set. We apply the parameterized NEO-B2PLYP model to compute the energetics of protonated water hexamers as well as a challenging example for proton dynamics, a crown ether molecule. In the latter case we compare the energetics of localized vs shared proton configurations. Overall, a ratio of about 0.8:0.2 (DFT:MP2) in the electron-proton correlation delivers a robust improvement across the models, even with variations in the basis sets used and the type of chemical bonds investigated.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-07-15T13:25:41.297Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6873cc7c728bf9025e432026/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6873c992fc5f0acb5207f9e0/original/hybrid-electron-proton-correlation-in-multicomponent-density-functional-theory.pdf

A critical step in GEM involves density fitting via Tychonov regularization, where the choice of the regularization parameter ( λ) has traditionally relied on manual optimization, a tedious and non-systematic process. In this work, we present an automated approach to determine λ by implementing the Dis- crete Picard Condition (DPC), a method designed to stabilize solutions for ill-posed inverse problems. DPC ensures that the decay rate of the solution coefficients aligns with the singular values of the fitting matrix, enabling ro- bust regularization without manual intervention. We validate this method by comparing intermolecular interactions for water dimers and ionic liquid systems against reference quantum mechanical and previously reported data. Results demonstrate that DPC-derived λ values yield interaction energies in close agreement with manually optimized parameters, achieving agreeable er- rors for most ABSs. Notably, DPC eliminates guesswork while maintaining accuracy, as evidenced by its successful integration into the GEM fit soft- ware and the Psi4 quantum chemistry suite.

Moreover, what little benchmarking studies are available primarily focus on the docking aspect of the pipelines, which is usually only the beginning or near the beginning, and even there, authors tend to use flawed data sets that artificially inflate performance metrics. Herein, we present an alternative method to pipeline validation and data set generation that requires no additional experimental work and expenditure, yet offers negative data that is vastly superior both in terms of quality and quantity to any data set used in vHTS pipeline validation up to now. By randomizing ligands across published experimental structures and generating structural isomers of known binders, practically unlimited amounts of negative data can be generated. Such sets of positive and negative data points match closely in molecular properties and are much more suitable for pipeline validation and have far greater evidentiary value than any of the current sets. Once such sets are generated, they are to be run through any proposed pipeline, assessing performance at every step. We stress the importance of using negative data of adequate quality and quantity in validation studies to definitively and verifiably demonstrate the utility of a given tool or workflow.

In ab-initio molecular dynamics methods, any kind of matter is described by applying the Schrödinger equation to the electronic structure and using classical Newton dynamics for the motion of the atomic nuclei. By lots of calculations on this basis, it has become obvious that this concept is superior to a quantum chemical description of nuclear motion. The nuclei move according to Newton's laws in a perfectly local and deterministic way while the surrounding electronic cloud determines bonding and antibonding interactions between the atoms. The resulting theory is a deterministic formulation of quantum mechanics which is free from paradoxa and is able to explain complex phenomena like photochemistry.

Similar mechanisms are also fundamental to biological systems, including enzyme catalysis and cellular signaling. At sub-nanometer scales, confinement and interfacial interactions dramatically reshape the molecular landscape, challenging conventional assumptions about pH and chemical reactivity. Here, we combine density-corrected density functional theory with machine-learned interatomic potentials to investigate the autoionization of water confined to quasi-two-dimensional monolayers within sub-nanometer slit pores. We find that extreme confinement markedly suppresses water autoionization, raising the effective pKw by more than two units. This suppression originates from hydroxide ion destabilization at interfaces, driven by restricted hydrogen bonding, hindered molecular reorientation, and a breakdown of Grotthuss proton transport caused by topological frustration in the hydrogen-bond network.
