10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zd9mr-v5,A Computational Community Blind Challenge on Pan-Coronavirus Drug Discovery Data,"Computational blind challenges offer critical, unbiased assessment opportunities to assess and accelerate scientific progress, as demonstrated by a breadth of breakthroughs over the last decade. We report the outcomes and key insights from an open science community blind challenge focused on computational methods in drug discovery, using lead optimization data from the AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) Discovery Consortium’s pan-coronavirus antiviral discovery program, in partnership with Polaris and the OpenADMET project. This collaborative initiative invited global participants from both academia and industry to develop and apply computational methods to predict the biochemical potency and crystallographic ligand poses of small molecules against key coronavirus targets, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) main protease (Mpro), as well as multiple ADMET assay endpoints, using previously undisclosed comprehensive experimental drug discovery datasets as benchmarks. By evaluating submissions across multiple tasks and compounds, we established performance leaderboards and conducted meta-analyses to assess methodological strengths, common pitfalls, and areas for improvement. This analysis provides a foundation for best practices in real-world machine learning evaluation, grounded in community-driven benchmarking. We also highlight how next-generation platforms, such as Polaris, enable rigorous challenge design, embedded evaluation frameworks, and broad community engagement. This paper reports the collective findings of the challenge, offering a high-level overview of the data, evaluation infrastructure, and top- performing strategies. We further provide context and support for the accompanying papers authored by the challenge participants in this special issue, which explore individual approaches in greater depth. Together, these contributions aim to advance reproducible, trustworthy, and high-impact computational methods in drug discovery, and to explore best practices and pitfalls in future blind challenge design and execution, including planned initiatives for the OpenADMET project.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence,2025-11-07T20:38:08.194Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Figures', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690e3028113cc7cfffc216a6/original/supplementary-figures.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690e3027113cc7cfffc21625/original/a-computational-community-blind-challenge-on-pan-coronavirus-drug-discovery-data.pdf

However, this structural diversity complicates the quantitative sampling of their conformational landscape, even for simple single-stranded RNA tetramers. We show that combining explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) with enhanced sampling algorithms can effectively explore the complex free energy landscapes of RNA tetramers. Our simulations capture key conformational states, such as stacked, intercalated, nucleobase-flipped, and random coil structures, while reproducing unbiased populations with much less computational effort than conventional molecular dynamics. This data-driven approach distinguishes several metastable states that are often indistinguishable in standard analysis. Additionally, our interpretable machine learning framework identifies key torsion angles driving slow transitions and those responsible for unphysical intercalated structures, paving the way for improvements in nucleic acid force fields.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-11-07T11:55:14.424Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6908809def936fb4a20bb487/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6908809def936fb4a20bb47e/original/characterizing-rna-tetramer-conformational-landscape-using-explainable-machine-learning.pdf

With the recent surge of AI and deep learning frameworks, it remains unclear whether these modern techniques offer statistically significant improvement over the well-established classical methods. The 2025 ASAP-Polaris-OpenADMET Antiviral Challenge provided a unique benchmarking opportunity to address this question, joined by over 65 teams of computational scientists worldwide. Our submissions were among the top performers in terms of Pearson r correlation, ranked first in pIC50 prediction for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and fourth in aggregated ADME.  In this work, we present a retrospective analysis of our modeling strategies and highlight our lessons learned. Through rigorous statistical benchmarking, we demonstrate that while classical methods remain highly competitive for predicting potency, modern deep learning algorithms significantly outperformed traditional machine learning in ADME prediction. We also illustrate the importance of appropriate data curation and the benefits of leveraging public datasets via feature augmentation.

Scalable investigation of their thermodynamic and kinetic properties requires the use of automated reaction prediction tools, which is a rapidly growing area in the study of chemical reactivity. However, the systematic exploration of intricate reaction networks involving highly reactive intermediates continues to pose significant difficulties. Here, we introduce RxnNet, a novel artificial intelligence-assisted platform for the automated prediction of chemical reaction mechanisms. RxnNet integrates heuristic rules with domain-specific chemical knowledge including stereochemistry, regiochemistry, conformational preferences, and isotope labeling, to construct mechanistically informed reaction networks. These networks are represented as graphs and are coupled with on-the-fly quantum chemical evaluations to identify all feasible intermediates and transition states. In this work, we apply RxnNet to carbocation chemistry, a notoriously complex and computationally demanding type of reaction. We demonstrate the method’s capabilities by analyzing three multistep reactions with known mechanisms, each of which poses significant challenges even for expert computational and synthetic chemists. RxnNet provides a robust approach for uncovering reaction mechanisms, which can accelerate the understanding and design of transformations in complex chemical systems.

This work introduces ChemReactLLM, a multimodal large language model designed to transform catalyst-driven organic reaction prediction and optimization. ChemReactLLM integrates a foundation language model with a specialized ReactAdapter for molecular structure embedding and a Text–Structure Cross-Attention Block that fuses textual experimental conditions with graph-based structural representations. Trained on a large multimodal dataset, the model predicts reaction outcomes, infers catalyst structure–activity relationships, and supports inverse catalyst design. Experiments demonstrate superior performance in yield prediction and robust generalization to unseen reactions. ChemReactLLM also provides mechanistic interpretability and chemically consistent reasoning, highlighting its potential to accelerate catalyst discovery and advance data-driven organic synthesis.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence,2025-11-05T05:19:07.866Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6903fc59113cc7cfff217f3a/original/chem-react-llm-a-multimodal-large-language-model-for-catalyst-driven-organic-reaction-prediction-and-optimization.pdf

Quantum mechanical calculations are accurate but often prohibitively expensive.  Deep learning has emerged as a faster alternative, but progress is slowed by a fragmented software ecosystem that hinders reuse, fair comparison, and reproducibility. We present ChemTorch, an open-source framework that streamlines model development, experimentation, hyperparameter tuning, and benchmarking through modular pipelines, standardized configuration, and built-in data splitters for in- and out-of-distribution evaluation.  We envision ChemTorch as a foundation for community-driven method development and reproducible benchmarking in chemical reaction modeling. As a first step toward unified benchmarks, we compare four representative modalities for barrier-height prediction on the RDB7 dataset, including fingerprint-, sequence-, graph-, and 3D-based approaches.  Our results highlight clear advantages of structurally informed models and sharp performance drops under out-of-distribution conditions, highlighting the importance of rigorous benchmarking.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-11-04T10:19:19.832Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690357d9a482cba122e366b6/original/chem-torch-a-deep-learning-framework-for-benchmarking-and-developing-chemical-reaction-property-prediction-models.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-w1wsh,Bayesian Optimization for Biochemical Discovery with LLMs,"Incorporating prior domain knowledge into Bayesian optimization (BO) remains difficult for statistical methods, which also typically suffer from limited interpretability. Large language models (LLMs) offer complementary strengths in reasoning and knowledge integration, but it remains unclear when and how they improve BO. We address this gap through a systematic analysis of the success and failure modes of LLM-enabled approaches to BO and propose strategies to overcome their limitations. Two types of scientific tasks are benchmarked: molecular optimization using string-based representations and optimization of four-residue binding motifs within proteins. In the molecular task, we find that poor data comprehension and the limited ability to process large in-context data hinder LLM performance. Accordingly, we propose an agentic workflow that orchestrates chemical tools and statistical BO and show its effectiveness. In the protein task, reasoning LLMs prove effective at domain knowledge-based hypothesis generation, improving optimization performance while providing interpretable design strategies. Across both domains, we observe a tendency for LLMs to overfixate on irrelevant context, where withholding information paradoxically improves performance. These results clarify the conditions under which LLMs enhance BO and suggest hybrid approaches that combine statistical rigor with LLM-enabled reasoning and interpretability.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Materials Science; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-11-04T05:55:20.824Z,"[{'title': 'Appendix', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69028f65a482cba122c9dfbb/original/appendix.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69028bd1ef936fb4a216199a/original/bayesian-optimization-for-biochemical-discovery-with-ll-ms.pdf

We present MDtrajNet-1, a foundational AI model that directly generates MD trajectories across chemical space, bypassing force calculations and integration. This approach accelerates simulations by up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional MD, even those enhanced by machine-learning interatomic potentials. MDtrajNet-1 combines equivariant neural networks with a Transformer-based architecture to achieve strong accuracy and transferability in predicting long-time trajectories for both known and unseen systems. Remarkably, the errors of the trajectories generated by MDtrajNet-1 for various molecular systems are close to those of the conventional ab initio MD. The model’s flexible design supports diverse application scenarios, including different statistical ensembles, boundary conditions, and interaction types.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-8swnn,Design of Hybrid Quasi-2D Perovskite Ligands to Improve Stability,"Quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) metal-halide perovskites hold great promise for optoelectronic applications through their unique ability to accommodate bulky organic ligands while maintaining structural flexibility, offering advantages over conventional 3D perovskites that are constrained by strict tolerance factors. Nevertheless, contemporary ligand design remains severely limited by trial-and-error experimentation and conservative heuristics, with fewer than 100 ligands experimentally validated and minimal understanding of structure-stability relationships. Here, we address this gap through a high-throughput computational framework that systematically evaluated over 10,000 ligands on n=3 Ruddlesden–Popper Q2D perovskites using molecular dynamics simulations, generating the largest dataset of stable and unstable ligand examples to date. Machine learning classifiers trained on this comprehensive dataset achieve 97\% accuracy in predicting ligand stability, correctly identifying all experimentally validated ligands while revealing key design principles including the critical roles of side-chain bulk, linker geometry, and body unit positioning. Comparative analysis with n=1 2D perovskites demonstrates that Q2D structures accommodate ligands differently due to stress mitigation from multiple intervening layers, establishing dimension-specific design rules. This framework provides a transformative approach to accelerated ligand discovery, demonstrating that the viable design space for Q2D perovskites vastly exceeds current experimental exploration.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry,2025-11-08T21:19:17.286Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69048f08113cc7cfff41e2ef/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69048dacef936fb4a27cd12a/original/design-of-hybrid-quasi-2d-perovskite-ligands-to-improve-stability.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-68g6s,Machine Learning-Accelerated Path Integral Molecular Dynamics and 13C NMR Simulations Unlock New Insights Into Quantum Effects in C60 Fullerene,"A definitive answer on the existence and magnitude of the negative thermal expansion (NTE) and its effect on 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signature in C60 fullerene has been previously demonstrated using quantum-mechanical treatments of thermal rovibrational motion. This approach, while accurate, is computationally expensive and lacks the implementation of dispersion corrections, limiting its scope for exploring the influence of such effects on the observed NTE. Alternative methods, such as ab initio path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD), are more flexible but remain computationally expensive, especially when combined with 13C NMR parameter calculations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an accurate and efficient neural network–based approach that combines machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with an NMR machine learning (NMR-ML) model. The MLIPs enable machine learning PIMD (MLPIMD) simulations, while the NMR-ML model computes 13C isotropic magnetic shielding, σiso, directly from MLPIMD snapshots. We perform temperature-dependent MLPIMD simulations with MLIPs trained at different levels of theory. In all cases, NTE is observed, and the results reveal how both dispersion and basis set choices influence its magnitude. Furthermore, we confirm that NTE cannot be observed using classical MD simulations, highlighting its quantum-mechanical origin. To further tests our approach, we investigate 13C NMR, by performing 13C σiso calculations for the three C60 isotopomers, including one with 13C at a site shared by one pentagon and two hexagons, one with two 13C at a C–C bond shared by two hexagons, and one with two 13C at a C–C bond shared by a hexagon and a pentagon. The results show a good agreement with the experimental data, highlighting the accuracy of our approach. This work demonstrates that ML-accelerated simulations enable accurate and efficient modeling of thermally activated quantum mechanical phenomena.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Carbon-based Materials; Machine Learning; Quantum Mechanics,2025-11-06T05:20:44.128Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information for ""Machine Learning-Accelerated Path Integral Molecular Dynamics and 13C NMR Simulations Unlock New Insights Into Quantum Effects in C60 Fullerene""', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690a0c71a482cba122fa96b9/original/supporting-information-for-machine-learning-accelerated-path-integral-molecular-dynamics-and-13c-nmr-simulations-unlock-new-insights-into-quantum-effects-in-c60-fullerene.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6909f3e4113cc7cfff07d43a/original/machine-learning-accelerated-path-integral-molecular-dynamics-and-13c-nmr-simulations-unlock-new-insights-into-quantum-effects-in-c60-fullerene.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-9k7p7,Machine Learning-Accelerated Screening of Hydroquinone Analogs for Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer ,"Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mediated by hydroquinone and related molecules is key to natural and artificial energy conversion. The reactivity of these molecules depends on their bond dissociation free energy (BDFE), but studying the relationship between structure and thermochemistry across chemical space has been limited by computational expense. Here, we present the first use of the AIMNet2 neural network potential to calculate average BDFE (BDFEavg) values for the 2H+/2e− dehydrogenation of about 200,000 hydroquinone-like compounds, including vicinal diamines, diols, and dithiols. Benchmarking against DFT calculations for 168 substituted ortho-phenylenediamines (opda) shows good agreement (R² > 0.9). 
Our analysis finds that BDFEavg ranges from 50 to 80 kcal/mol and can be systematically tuned by modifying the backbone and N-substitution: electron-withdrawing groups raise BDFEavg by up to 15 kcal/mol, while lower aromaticity in furan and thiophene backbones decreases BDFEavg by approximately 10 kcal/mol compared to phenyl systems. We developed an additive ""offset model"" that allows separate investigation of backbone and sidechain effects. Validation through cyclic voltammetry and reactivity studies with quinone oxidants for selected compounds supports the computational results. This extensive thermochemical database and web-based prediction tool offer valuable resources for designing PCET reagents for catalysis, energy storage, and biomedical uses.

Ideally, the exploration does not require any collective variables that are based on prior chemical domain knowledge. With this in mind, we adapt the stochastic saddle point dynamics algorithm (SSPD) and assess its applicability to increasingly complex systems. We motivate the adaptation of the original SSPD algorithm using a simple 2D toy potential and illustrate why it is necessary to converge to reactive transition state regions. We then demonstrate that the adapted SSPD can efficiently sample the high-dimensional isomerization reaction of a seven-atom Lennard-Jones cluster. Combining SSPD with an automatically differentiable machine-learned interatomic potential, we study decomposition reactions of isopropanol. Thereby, we demonstrate how to target distinct reaction pathways in systems with multiple competing reactions. Finally, we apply the same framework to CO dissociation on a flat Co surface and show how finite-temperature effects influence the transition pathway from the initial minimum to the transition state.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning,2025-11-05T12:44:27.114Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information for Steering Langevin dynamics towards transition states using collective-variable-free resampling', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6904c3d9ef936fb4a2998bc6/original/supplementary-information-for-steering-langevin-dynamics-towards-transition-states-using-collective-variable-free-resampling.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6904bf4f113cc7cfff5babb4/original/steering-langevin-dynamics-towards-transition-states-using-collective-variable-free-resampling.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-7sd54,System-specific reparameterization of density functionals with machine learning: application to spin-splitting energies of transition metal complexes,"Accurate estimates of the spin-splitting energy (SSE) are essential for proper modeling of transition metal complex (TMC) catalysts and functional materials but are notoriously challenging to achieve. Over a large set of over 450 TMCs, we demonstrate that adding Hartree–Fock exchange (HFX) to semilocal density functionals (e.g., PBE or SCAN) in a system-specific fashion provides the flexibility to significantly reduce errors relative to reference wavefunction theory (i.e., DLPNO-CCSD(T)) values. Nevertheless, to do so requires that one knows the correct amount of HFX to add to the functional, which is system-dependent. We show that global reparameterizations, optimal ionization potential tuning, and machine learning models trained on atomic properties and molecular connectivity are all insufficient to reliably improve results relative to standard hybrid functionals. Instead, we utilize a Behler–Parrinello neural network trained on the electron density generated by a hybrid functional to predict the optimal amount of HFX to include, achieving errors on the unseen test set of <5% HFX, corresponding to 3–4 kcal/mol errors. These results are competitive with the best single functionals on these data sets, as well as previous approaches that utilize system-specific functional recommendation, providing a path to a ML-derived self-tuning functional based on the electron density. This approach provides a practical and interpretable way to increase the accuracy of density functionals, which will enable more reliable and efficient screening of chemical space.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning,2025-11-05T11:40:51.405Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6904cfc5ef936fb4a29b2256/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6904c96d113cc7cfff5f09e4/original/system-specific-reparameterization-of-density-functionals-with-machine-learning-application-to-spin-splitting-energies-of-transition-metal-complexes.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-chlcc-v2,"Machine-Learning Adaptivity, DFT-Level Accuracy, and Semi-Empirical Quantum-Chemistry Speed with Neural-Network Extended Tight-Binding","Fast, general, and interpretable quantum accuracy remains challenging. We introduce Neural‑Network Extended Tight‑Binding (NN‑xTB), a Hamiltonian‑preserving scheme that augments the explicit GFN2‑xTB operator with small, bounded, environment‑dependent shifts to a compact set of physically interpretable parameters predicted by an E(3)‑equivariant encoder. NN‑xTB confines learning to atom/shell local parameters and to a few global scalings, enhancing local chemical adaptivity while preserving analytic long‑range limits, native charge and spin treatment, and self‑consistency, and  ensuring that all observables are derived from a single adapted electronic state.  
Across complementary benchmarks, NN‑xTB attains DFT‑like accuracy at near‑xTB cost. On GMTKN55 it achieves a WTMAD‑2 of 5.6 kcal/mol (versus   25.0 kcal/mol for GFN2‑xTB and 9.3 kcal/mol for g‑xTB). Relative to strong equivariant Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs), NN‑xTB yields the lowest force MAE on 8/10 molecules for the rMD17 dataset and delivers 10–40% RMSE reductions on large subsets of MACEOFF23 and SPICE. Under temperature shift on the 3BPA dataset, errors remain substantially below competing MLIPs up to 1200 K, indicating stronger out‑of‑distribution generalization. On VQM24, the vibrational‑frequency MAE drops from 200.6 (GFN2‑xTB) to 12.7 cm^{-1} (>90% reduction). The neural component adds <20% wall‑time overhead, preserving the throughput that motivates semi‑empirical quantum methods.  
By adapting the Hamiltonian rather than directly regressing energies or forces, NN-xTB bridges much of the accuracy gap to DFT while retaining interpretability, correct asymptotics, and robustness, offering a practical route to quantum-accurate molecular simulation and modeling at scale.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Quantum Mechanics,2025-11-05T09:23:45.063Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information: Machine-Learning Adaptivity, DFT-Level Accuracy, and Semi-Empirical Quantum-Chemistry Speed with Neural-Network Extended Tight-Binding', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69053bb5ef936fb4a2aac23a/original/supplementary-information-machine-learning-adaptivity-dft-level-accuracy-and-semi-empirical-quantum-chemistry-speed-with-neural-network-extended-tight-binding.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69053bb5ef936fb4a2aac231/original/machine-learning-adaptivity-dft-level-accuracy-and-semi-empirical-quantum-chemistry-speed-with-neural-network-extended-tight-binding.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-46p89-v2,"MolecularWeb Democratizes Web-Based, Immersive, Multiuser Molecular Graphics And Modeling","For decades, molecular visualization software has been fundamental to education and research in chemistry, structural biology, and materials science. These tools have enabled the inspection of structures, dynamics, and interactions, yet their reliance on two-dimensional (2D) interfaces imposes persistent limitations. Traditional screen–mouse systems are poorly suited to conveying the inherently three-dimensional (3D) nature of molecules, and thoughtful manipulation of structures remains cumbersome even for expert users. Such barriers are particularly acute for students and occasional users, for whom intuitive understanding is critical. Immersive technologies under the umbrella of eXtended Reality (XR)—including Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)—offer a paradigm shift. By situating molecules directly in 3D space, XR facilitates both perception and manipulation, making abstract concepts more tangible. Educational benefits include heightened engagement and improved spatial reasoning, while for research XR offers more fluid collaborative exploration of molecular systems. Historically, adoption was limited by expensive, bulky hardware and complex software installation. The WebXR standard now addresses these issues by enabling cross-platform immersive experiences directly through browsers, eliminating installation barriers and improving accessibility. The MolecularWeb ecosystem (https://molecularweb.org) exploits these advances to deliver immersive molecular graphics and modeling widely. Its first platform, moleculARweb, brings “commodity AR” to everyday devices such as laptops and smartphones. Using simple fiducial markers or markerless AR, students can view and manipulate molecular structures in real time. Modules cover orbitals, VSEPR geometries, hydrogen bonding, and biomolecular assemblies, while Virtual Modeling Kits provide rudimentary molecular mechanics. Teachers report that these activities improve engagement and help clarify difficult concepts. To expand flexibility, the companion tool PDB2AR allows users to generate custom AR/VR scenes from Protein Data Bank entries, AlphaFold models, or objects exported from visualization software. These can be explored in stand-alone AR/VR or within MolecularWebXR, a multiuser immersive platform. MolecularWebXR provides shared virtual rooms where participants, represented as avatars, can examine curated content on chemistry, materials, and biology, or import their own structures. This framework has been deployed in classrooms, outreach events, and scientific meetings, highlighting its value as a medium for collaborative discussion. The most recent development, HandMol, moves beyond static visualization. Its prototypes enable multiuser, bare-handed manipulation of molecular structures with real-time feedback from molecular mechanics engines. Features include on-the-fly minimization, collaborative docking, seamless file exchange, and natural language control through language models. Soon to be integrated into MolecularWebXR, HandMol transforms immersive visualization into an interactive modeling environment suitable for both education and research. Together, these tools illustrate the progression from 2D visualization to dynamic, collaborative XR systems.

Accurate modeling of these systems is essential for obtaining mechanistic insights, but remains computationally demanding. Hybrid machine-learned/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) simulations offer a promising compromise between quantum accuracy and computational efficiency. However, most existing ML/MM methods exclude solvent molecules from the ML region, limiting their ability to capture solvent-mediated reactivity. In this study, we introduce a solvent-inclusive ML/MM methodology that addresses this limitation. Our approach defines the ML and MM regions using a fixed spatial boundary, avoiding costly topology updates, and handles interactions across the boundary using a force-partitioning scheme. We evaluate our framework through simulations of bulk water and the solvent-mediated dissociation of formic acid using different ML region sizes. Our results reveal that structural and dynamical properties of bulk water are preserved for sufficiently large ML regions. Notably, we show that the choice of the potential energy surface representation for the ML and MM regions can affect these properties, especially at smaller ML region sizes. Our calculations of the free energy profiles for formic acid dissociation also show trends consistent with reference systems, but deviations are observed. We comment on potential reasons for these observations. Overall, our study highlights the promise of ML/MM approaches that are solvent-inclusive and provides directions for further development.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning,2025-11-04T12:34:05.621Z,"[{'title': 'Supplemental Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ffa010a482cba122597d2d/original/supplemental-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ffa010a482cba122597d21/original/solvent-inclusive-ml-mm-simulations-assessments-of-structural-dynamical-and-thermodynamic-accuracy.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-l6j8v,ProQSAR: A Modular and Reproducible Framework for Small-Data QSAR Modeling with Fit-and-Use Models,"Background: Quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models are central to computer-aided drug discovery and predictive toxicology, but practical adoption is often impeded by ad-hoc tooling, inconsistent validation protocols, and poor reproducibility. Objective: We introduce ProQSAR, a modular, reproducible workbench that formalizes end-to-end QSAR development while permitting independent use of each component. Methods: ProQSAR composes interchangeable modules for standardization, feature generation, splitting (including scaffold- and cluster-aware splits), preprocessing, outlier handling, scaling, feature selection, model training and tuning, statistical comparison, conformal calibration, and applicability-domain assessment. The pipeline can run end-to-end to produce versioned artifact bundles (serialized models, transformers, split indices, provenance metadata) and analyst-oriented reports suitable for deployment and audit. Results: On representative MoleculeNet benchmarks evaluated under Bemis–Murcko scaffold-aware protocols, ProQSAR attains state-of-the-art descriptor-based performance: the lowest mean RMSE across the regression suite (ESOL, FreeSolv, Lipophilicity; mean RMSE 0.658 ± 0.12), including a substantial improvement on FreeSolv (RMSE 0.494 vs. 0.731 for a leading graph method). For classification, ProQSAR achieves the top ROC–AUC on ClinTox (91.4%) while remaining competitive on BACE and BBBP (overall classification average 75.5 ± 11.4). Crucially, all predictions are accompanied by cross-conformal prediction and explicit applicability-domain flags that identify out-of-scope inputs, enabling calibrated, risk-aware decision support. Availability: ProQSAR is released on PyPI, Conda, and Docker Hub; all releases embed full provenance (parameters, package versions, checksums) to ensure reproducibility. Scientific contribution: ProQSAR (i) enforces best-practice, group-aware validation together with formal statistical comparisons across models, (ii) integrates calibrated uncertainty quantification (cross-conformal prediction) and applicability-domain diagnostics for interpretable, risk-aware predictions, and (iii) exposes both a composable developer API and a one-click pipeline that generates deployment-ready artifacts and human-readable reports, demonstrated on representative benchmarks.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-11-04T08:43:57.453Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ff98c2113cc7cfff68db09/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e6a58abc2ac3a0e0f1aaed/original/pro-qsar-a-modular-and-reproducible-framework-for-small-data-qsar-modeling-with-fit-and-use-models.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j0vns,Parallel Procedures for Efficient Construction of Potential Energy Surfaces Based on Multireference Methods,"The exploration of potential energy surfaces is central to the understanding of reactions in the ground and excited states. The construction of potential energy surfaces with multireference methods are usually done sequentially, meaning the calculation usually starts from one geometry, and the molecular orbitals and configuration interaction coefficients are carried over to a successive geometry close to the previous geometry, and so on, ensuring fast and reliable convergence to the desired solution. While this is likely to yield smooth and reasonable potential energy surfaces, it can be slow due to having to wait until the previous calculation completes to start the calculation with the next geometry. When multiple computer processors are available, multiple geometries could theoretically be calculated in parallel, given that appropriate initial guess is provided. Based on this, in this work, we devise a set of procedures that balance the reliability of a sequential calculation to obtain the potential energy surfaces with the efficiency enabled by parallel computing to various degrees. We demonstrated the usefulness of the procedures in constructing ground-state potential energy curves of Cr2, Cu2, and Mg2 with complete active space self-consistent field and second-order n-electron valence state perturbation theory. We make a recommendation on procedures which can be used to maximize the parallelization of potential energy surface construction without sacrificing the quality of results.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-11-07T05:40:33.302Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information (PDF)', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6903d26c113cc7cfff1362af/original/supporting-information-pdf.pdf'}, {'title': 'Supporting Information (ZIP)', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69080bd1a482cba122afc635/original/supporting-information-zip.zip'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69039fd1ef936fb4a247fb77/original/parallel-procedures-for-efficient-construction-of-potential-energy-surfaces-based-on-multireference-methods.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fn75m,Density Functional Theory Prediction of Spin Ground States in FeN4-based Model Complexes for FeNC Catalysts,"FeNC catalysts hold promise as substitution materials for noble metal catalysts in electrochemical reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction or the CO2 reduction reaction. However, both their geometric and electronic structure are still insufficiently understood, which is why computational models are needed for a detailed interpretation of spectroscopic and catalytic data. Since both spectroscopic and catalytic properties depend strongly on the electronic structure, reliable methods for predicting the spin ground state of the catalytic center are indispensable for meaningful theoretical investigations of FeNC catalysts. Therefore, we herein present computational protocols for the accurate prediction of spin ground states for FeNx environments based on a set of 21 molecular complexes using molecular and periodic DFT approaches. We tested density functionals from various rungs of Jacob's ladder, finding that the R2SCAN meta-GGA-functional performs well with both molecular and periodic approaches. In addition, the OPBE or the OLYP functionals perform equally well in the molecular protocols, and the HSE06 and B3LYP functionals yield good predictions in the periodic approach. We discuss the importance of additional components of the computational protocol, specifically dispersion correction and implicit solvation.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Theory - Inorganic; Transition Metal Complexes (Inorg.); Theory - Computational,2025-11-06T01:46:52.180Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Figures for ""Density Functional Theory Prediction of Spin Ground States in FeN4-based Model Complexes for FeNC Catalysts""', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69029860ef936fb4a2197114/original/supplementary-figures-for-density-functional-theory-prediction-of-spin-ground-states-in-fe-n4-based-model-complexes-for-fe-nc-catalysts.pdf'}, {'title': 'Supplementary Tables for ""Density Functional Theory Prediction of Spin Ground States in FeN4-based Model Complexes for FeNC Catalysts""', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6902988eef936fb4a2197f75/original/supplementary-tables-for-density-functional-theory-prediction-of-spin-ground-states-in-fe-n4-based-model-complexes-for-fe-nc-catalysts.xlsx'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69028f02ef936fb4a216a11c/original/density-functional-theory-prediction-of-spin-ground-states-in-fe-n4-based-model-complexes-for-fe-nc-catalysts.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3mng1-v2,PathGennie: Rapid Generation of Rare Event Pathways via Direction-Guided Adaptive Sampling Using Ultrashort Monitored Trajectories,"Generating mechanistic pathways of rare events like ligand unbinding or protein folding is a central challenge in molecular dynamics simulation of complex molecular processes. Here, we present PathGennie, a direction-guided adaptive sampling framework that rapidly generates transition pathways without external biasing forces or thermal perturbation. The method launches swarms of ultrashort (a few femtoseconds long), unbiased trajectories and selectively propagates only those that exhibit progress towards a defined goal in a possibly high-dimensional collective variable space, thus circumventing long waiting times while preserving the true dynamics. We demonstrate the broad applicability and efficiency of PathGennie by identifying multiple competing unbinding pathways for benzene in T4 lysozyme and imatinib from Abl kinase, as well as capturing the folding and unfolding transitions of the Trp-cage and Protein G fast-folding proteins. Multiple competing pathways have been identified that are consistent with earlier reports. The method generates physically meaningful transition pathways on a picosecond timescale (~10-100 ps) for these systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these pathways serve as excellent initial seeds for path sampling methods, e.g. weighted ensemble (WE) simulations, substantially accelerating the convergence of rate constants compared to standard WE protocols.
