10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rq1vl-v2,Large-Scale Virtual Screening Identifies Novel Allosteric Modulators of TIMP2: A Computational Approach to Enhancing Neuroplasticity,"TIMP2 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2) plays a crucial role in hippocampal neuroplasticity and cognitive function through MMP-independent signaling. Despite its therapeutic promise, TIMP2 has long been considered 'undruggable' due to its cryptic surface topology and lack of canonical active sites.  We present a novel computational pipeline integrating CNS-filtered virtual screening, ADMET and toxicity filtering, and allosteric site targeting to identify small-molecule modulators of TIMP2. Using a representative sampling of over 500,000 ligands from the ZINC20 database, we performed structure-based docking against two putative allosteric sites (a canonical MMP-2-facing surface and a newly characterized cryptic cleft). Visualization via PyMOL revealed plausible binding conformations supporting selective engagement with the cryptic allosteric pocket.  Our findings challenge the notion of TIMP2 as an undruggable protein and establish a reproducible framework for targeting low-tractability proteins through AI-assisted virtual screening and multi-objective optimization.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-d1j8k,Uncovering Internal Prediction Mechanisms of Transformer-Based Chemical Foundation Models,"Supervised deep learning has become a standard approach to deliver competitive predictive tools that allow relating the structure of molecules and their physicochemical features to properties such as binding to protein targets, performance as electronic materials, and reactivity. However, efforts to understand how these models learn and how specific predictions can be explained are still limited in chemistry, which hinders trust in these predictions. To overcome both the current widespread approach of considering supervised deep learning models as black boxes and the limitations of explainable deep learning based on feature attribution, we introduce two general methods from the field of mechanistic interpretability to molecular property prediction. Specifically, we leverage ablation and adapt existing techniques into the regression lens to inspect model predictions of the Transformer-based ChemBERTa foundation model. Our results for 3 ChemBERTa-based models finetuned on distinct datasets allow us to propose the internal mechanisms operable within each of the corresponding model layers that lead to the final predictions.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jbq19,MolCraftDiffusion: 3D Molecular Generation Framework for Data-driven Molecular Applications,"Equivariant diffusion models have recently been explored for 3D molecular structure generation, yet their practical deployment is hindered by two major challenges: the high cost of training and the lack of standardized guidance methods to steer generation toward desired geometries or properties. Existing guidance approaches are typically task-specific, limiting general applicability. We introduce MolCraftDiffusion, a generative AI framework for building and adapting molecular diffusion models to data-driven applications in computational chemistry. As part of the package, we implement curriculum learning, a progressive chemical complexity learning approach that we apply to construct a pre-trained diffusion model on 3D molecular structure datasets compiled from multiple sources. This pre-trained model circumvents the need for costly full training whenever applied to a different application. The framework also includes modular guidance diffusion methods to guide the generation toward chemically relevant problems, such as maintaining a specific 3D chemical structure and specific molecular properties. Structure guidance uses molecular inpainting (systematic exploration of structural variants around a reference molecule) and outpainting (extending existing molecules with new chemical groups). Target guidance employs gradient-based and classifier-free methods to direct generation toward molecules with desired physicochemical properties, enabling applications. We illustrate these guidance generation capabilities across various computational chemistry tasks such as virtual library construction and inverse molecular design. This framework is implemented as a comprehensive software package that aims to facilitate accessible adoption of 3D molecular generation models.

state, a limitation exacerbated by the complex redistribution of intramolecular vibrational energy across multiple reaction coordinates. To overcome this challenge,
we present a theoretical framework that integrates local control theory (LCT) with
machine-learning nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (ML-NAMD) to design optimal
laser pulse shapes combining ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) components. Using
2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (DBO) as a model system, we demonstrate that the
tailored electric field significantly accelerates photodissociation and enhances product
yield. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds not via the conventional transition state
pathway but through a higher-energy intermediate configuration, enabled by the fieldinduced selective excitation of specific vibrational modes. This nonequilibrium route
effectively bypasses the intrinsic barrier, promoting efficient reaction dynamics. The optimized field maintains its efficacy even at low temperatures, underscoring its robustness
against thermal fluctuations.

Their vast compositional space, spanning bulk alloys, defects, impurities, surfaces, and surface defects, poses significant challenges for efficient exploration and optimization. To address this, we trained a unified graph-based deep learned interatomic potential capable of optimizing and predicting energetics across these diverse structural motifs and navigating the complex potential energy surface (PES). Using a comprehensive density functional theory dataset of HaP structures, which includes bulk alloys, native and impurity defects, and surface slabs, we rigorously trained and benchmarked the M3GNet-based machine learning interatomic potential (IAP). The M3GNet-IAP framework, trained on DFT-calculated energies, forces, and stresses, enables gradient-based optimization and efficient exploration of the PES. Our models, trained on a dataset of∼12,000 HaP structures across diverse structural do- mains, demonstrated robust generalizability across the complex PES, achieving low er- rors (energies(E): 3.7 meV/atom; forces(f): 16.5 meV/Å; stresses(σ): 5.5 MPa), and accurately predicting formation energies, decomposition energies, defect energies, and surface energies.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rd9v8,Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification and Sensitivity Analysis for the H₂ + OH → H₂O + H Reaction: A Comprehensive Comparison of Ten Kinetic Studies,"Abstract
The reaction H₂ + OH → H₂O + H is fundamental to hydrogen combustion, atmospheric chemistry, and energy systems. Despite numerous experimental studies, comprehensive statistical comparison with modern uncertainty quantification has been lacking. This study presents a systematic analysis of ten independent kinetic investigations (1981-2021) spanning 200-3044 K, employing multiple complementary approaches: (1) comparative statistical analysis of modified Arrhenius expressions from diverse experimental methods; (2) Bayesian uncertainty quantification determining posterior distributions with decomposed measurement and inter-study variability; (3) parameter sensitivity analysis; (4) machine learning validation; and (5) temperature-zone optimization. Bayesian analysis reveals 14.6% average uncertainty with excellent agreement (CV 10-20%) at combustion conditions (800-2000 K). Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that activation energy (Ea) dominates at low temperatures (T < 700 K, sensitivity >5), while the temperature exponent (n) becomes critical above 1500 K. We provide application-specific recommendations: atmospheric chemistry (Atkinson et al., 2004; Sutherland et al., 1996), combustion modeling (Yang et al., 2021), and high-temperature applications (Hong et al., 2010). Machine learning models achieve R² > 0.999 for interpolation but confirm modified Arrhenius expressions remain superior for extrapolation. All analysis code, datasets, and Bayesian posteriors are provided open-source. This comprehensive evaluation establishes robust uncertainty bounds for a critical elementary reaction and demonstrates the value of Bayesian methods in chemical kinetics.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2zdsw,The Interaction of Hydrogen with Iron under High Pressure and Temperature,"Adsorbed hydrogen (Had) plays a critical role in Fe-catalyzed processes such as the synthesis of ammonia. We have developed a constant-pressure molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction of a dense hot hydrogen gas with the (110) iron surface at the operando conditions of pressures above 150 bar and temperatures larger than 700 K. In order to carry out this study, we have constructed a machine learning potential that is able to describe with ab initio accuracy the chemical processes that take place in this system. The Fe(110) surface, chosen for this study, is the most stable one and it is believed to be catalytically relevant. Upon impinging on the surface, the H2  molecule can dissociate and in turn the Had  atoms can diffuse, recombine and eventually return to the gas-phase. At operando conditions, a dynamical equilibrium between all these processes is established, leading to a hydrogen coverage that remains below saturation, pointing to reduced inhibition of the co-reactant adsorption. On the surface, the Had atoms are highly mobile, occasionally making short-lived subsurface excursions. We compute a large number of properties finding satisfactory agreement with experiments when available.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis,2025-11-11T11:32:23.257Z,"[{'title': 'The Interaction of Hydrogen with Iron under High Pressure and Temperature.

We introduce MARGR, a fully adaptive numerical framework that refines ML-predicted densities on tailored grids to achieve high-fidelity integration. By recursively subdividing regions where the density or its gradient exceeds a learned threshold, MARGR enables accurate computation of key chemical properties—including molecular volumes, van der Waals surfaces, and exchange-correlation energies—directly from standard uniform-grid ML outputs.

In response to this challenge, high-throughput screening and data-driven workflows that combine computational simulations, machine learning models, and materials databases have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating materials discovery. Spinels (AB2X4) stand out as a versatile class of materials with applications ranging from energy storage to catalysis. However, their full compositional space remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a data-driven framework to identify potentially synthesisable spinel compounds composed of the first 83 elements in the periodic table with oxygen (O2-) and three chalcogen anions (S2-, Se2-, Te2-). Over 30,000 charge-balanced and chemically plausible candidates, including inverse spinels, were sequentially filtered based on the stability, structural feasibility, and electronic properties criteria. Our workflow integrates materials databases, empirical heuristic rules, and machine learning predictions to efficiently reduce the candidate pool.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6b644,Expanding the chemical space of ionic liquids using conditional variational autoencoders,"Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts set apart by their low melting points and can act as highly tuneable solvents with broad application potential, for example as catalysts, in batteries, and for drug delivery. The potential chemical space of ILs is vast, with only a very small region having been explored to date. Machine learning offers a promising approach to advance into this vast space of unexplored ILs; however, existing IL databases contain limited ion diversity, constraining the performance of generative models. To address this, we introduce conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) and a novel ion scoring method as a conditioning factor. The ion score prioritises ions with a higher likelihood of forming low-melting-point ILs. Our CVAEs effectively generate novel and diverse cations and anions. Furthermore, we constructed a melting point prediction model to identify cation-anion pairs that are likely to yield ILs with low melting points. Visualisation of the generated ILs alongside existing ones reveals that our approach effectively expands the chemical space of ILs with novel structures. Molecular dynamics simulations further validate that 13/15 of the generated ILs possess desirable low melting points (<373 K).

This method avoids expansion into a full determinant basis, instead leveraging the operator structure inherent in the CSF coupling scheme to directly evaluate matrix elements. The approach enables a natural extension of the graphical unitary group approach (GUGA) to triplet spin-density operators, expressing matrix elements as products of segment values.

Calculations utilising the zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA) and effective core potentials (ECPs) with varying levels of relativistic treatment (Dirac-Hartree-Fock, Wood-Boring, and non-relativistic) were compared. Structural parameters, bonding characteristics (via FMO, NBO, and QTAIM analyses), and bond dissociation energies were evaluated. While relativistic ECPs and ZORA reproduce experimental bond lengths and bonding character, non-relativistic calculations overestimate U–P bonds by more than 5% and underestimate covalency, with bond dissociation energies reduced by up to 47 kJ/mol. Non-relativistic calculations revealed a better energy match of the frontier orbitals, but these are outweighed by the improved orbital overlap when including relativistic effects.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zvltv,Electronic-Structure Model for a Single Vacancy Defect,"We propose a first-principles electronic structure model for describing a single vacancy defect. Vacancy defects in semiconductors and insulators form color centers, whose localized trap states enable quantum functionalities. The properties of these defect states are affected by their interactions with the surrounding lattice and spin environments. Extensive theoretical efforts have been devoted to understanding such defect-environment couplings within periodic supercell models. While these approaches have provided valuable insights, accurate description of charged defects or nuclear motion associated with electron-phonon coupling requires approaching the dilute-defect limit, which in turn demands prohibitively large supercells and computational cost. Our new model eliminates the artificial periodicity inherent to the supercell model. A single defect is introduced into the pristine crystal under the assumption that the electronic density far from the defect remains nearly identical to that of the pristine system. For the insulating LiH-1D system, this assumption holds well, as neutral and charged defects form localized color centers consistent with the model. In contrast, for the metallic H-1D system, delocalized electronic behavior in charged defects violates this locality condition, limiting the applicability of the approach. We expect that this model can be broadly applicable to investigations of charged color centers and their interactions with the surrounding environment in insulating and semiconducting materials such as diamond, h-BN, transition-metal oxides, and dichalcogenides.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational,2025-11-14T07:03:40.048Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6910fef165a54c2d4a605114/original/electronic-structure-model-for-a-single-vacancy-defect.pdf

Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of twelve representative 2H-phase TMDs: NbS2, MoS2, TaS2, WS2, NbSe2, MoSe2, TaSe2, WSe2, NbTe2, MoTe2, TaTe2, and WTe2, using a suite of density functional theory (DFT) approaches. These include the semi-local PBE functional (bare and with D2, D3, D3M, D3+BJD, and D3M+BJD corrections) and six non-local vdW density functionals (vdW-DF, vdW-DF2, vdW-DF-OB86, vdW-DF-OBK8, vdW-DF-CX, and vdW-DF2-B86R). The results reveal that while no single vdW scheme is universally superior, a consistent subset: PBE+D3, vdW-DF-CX, vdW-DF-OB86, and vdW-DF2-B86R, achieves a balanced and physically reliable description. Among these, vdW-DF-CX and vdW-DF2-B86R provide the most accurate and transferable performance, closely followed by the widely used PBE+D3, which remains a practical choice for adsorption and intercalation studies. In contrast, PBE+D2 shows erratic behavior for W- and Ta-based TMDs, while D3M-based corrections systematically overbind and original vdW-DF and vdW-DF2 underbind, leading to inaccurate layer separations.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-t53z0-v2,Absolute Binding Affinity of a Phospholipid for a Membrane Protein,"The absolute binding affinity of a ligand determines site occupancy in functional assays and is a critical quantity for elucidating modulatory mechanisms. Established approaches for soluble ligands in enclosed cavities do not translate to lipophilic ligands on hydrophobic surfaces. These limitations impede efforts to resolve lipid-mediated mechanisms in transmembrane proteins. Here, we apply a formally exact computational method (Streamlined Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation, SAFEP) to calculate the absolute binding affinity of an anionic phospholipid for a potential modulatory site on a lipid-sensitive ion channel. Specifically, we calculate the affinity of palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) at a cryo-EM–suggested site on the Erwinia ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC). Within a double-decoupling scheme, we calculate the POPG bulk chemical potential in palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC)/POPG mixtures and the decoupling free energy from the cryo-EM–suggested site. We extend the restraint scheme of SAFEP to flexible chains and calculate an affinity of -9.7 +/- 0.8 kcal/mol for binding modes in which the glycerol backbone of POPG aligns with the cryo-EM lipid density. This value is consistent with our previous relative binding affinity calculations, while reducing the statistical error by a factor of three and relaxing assumptions required for that calculation. Unbiased simulations reveal that when the backbone is bound, the headgroup can adopt at least two distinct conformations, each interacting with protein residues with established functional implications. The bulk chemical potentials indicate weak non-ideality, showing modest reductions in excess chemical potential at 10–30 mol% POPG; these values can be paired with single decoupling of POPG from any site to avoid recalculating membrane non-ideality.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jv839-v3,Modeling chain relaxation in moderately entangled polyisoprene melts,"Chain relaxation in melts of moderately entangled macromolecules presents the first signs of topological constraints that are commonly manifested in the rheology of long commercial- grade polymers. In this study, we employ multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to examine the relaxation characteristics of model polyisoprene (PI) melts through the transition from the Rouse regime to entangled systems. We probed the impact of molecular weight and stereochemistry, and we evaluated the accuracy of theory in modeling the end-to-end relaxation. Our results support that trans-PI dynamics is distinct, with entanglements forming at a lower degree of polymerization than other compositions due to differences in the characteristic ratio and packing of this polymer. For all moderately entangled systems, modeling the end- to-end relaxation with the original Likhtman-McLeish theory with contour-length fluctuations presents deviations from recorded data both in the early-time and terminal regime. We propose numerical modifications that significantly improve the model for all systems studied without introducing additional parameters. Our approach allows accurate predictions for long macromolecules based on data from detailed simulations with moderately entangled polyisoprene systems.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Polymer Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Polymer chains; Theory - Computational; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-58147,The Algebraic Spin-Tensor Approach: I. Matrix Elements of the One-Electron Density Operator,"In this communication, a part of a series of three, we present a novel method, the algebraic spin-tensor approach (ASTA), for evaluating matrix elements between genealogical configuration state functions (CSFs) over operators with spin properties analogous to those of spherical harmonics. In this first communication, we demonstrate how this method is applicable, for instance, to operators of the unitary group, such as E_ij, and to the matrix elements of the one-electron density matrix, as explicitly demonstrated herein. Unlike the traditional unitary group approach, which relies on recurrence relations to compute all possible matrix elements, or the graphical unitary group approach, which derives expressions for segment values used in a product-like construction of matrix elements via induction, the method introduced here takes a fundamentally different route. We show that segment values can be directly obtained from the action of the creation operators defining the genealogical CSFs, interacting with the creation and annihilation operators of the unitary group operator. This formulation not only resolves the ambiguity inherent in the segment values of the graphical unitary group approach but also facilitates a straightforward extension to matrix elements involving the one-particle triplet operator - the subject of a subsequent communication.  Furthermore, the new approach demonstrates that these matrix elements can be evaluated without resorting to an intermediate transformation to a determinant representation.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational,2025-11-12T12:44:07.397Z,"[{'title': 'Full derivation of all segment values', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690e0c01113cc7cfffbe82bd/original/full-derivation-of-all-segment-values.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690e0ad2113cc7cfffbe665c/original/the-algebraic-spin-tensor-approach-i-matrix-elements-of-the-one-electron-density-operator.pdf

Unlike Slater determinants, CSFs are spin-adapted and offer a more compact representation of many-electron wave functions, but their use in quantum chemical methods is often hindered by the complexity of evaluating matrix elements. Our approach leverages a graphical representation to efficiently encode the expansion of CSFs in terms of Slater determinants without explicitly constructing the full expansion. The algorithm applies operator sequences directly to the graph and computes overlaps via graph traversal, yielding matrix elements, and is completely general for any operator sequence. Numerical tests demonstrate that the method achieves machine-level precision and outperforms explicit determinant expansion by several orders of magnitude. This framework opens new possibilities for CSF-based implementations in selected and stochastic configuration interaction methods.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational,2025-11-12T04:56:20.775Z,"[{'title': 'Implementation and test data', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690b3b88ef936fb4a27ed7cd/original/implementation-and-test-data.zip'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690b3a67113cc7cfff43256d/original/a-graph-based-algorithm-for-computing-matrix-elements-of-arbitrary-operators-between-configuration-state-functions.pdf

Electromagnetism, Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and Quantum Field Theory","Ab initio quantum chemistry aims to predict molecular properties solely from fundamental physical constants
and system composition, without empirical parameterization. This review elucidates how this endeavor is built upon an interdependent hierarchy of physical theories, each contributing essential concepts and introducing inherent approximations. We trace the foundational role of Classical Mechanics via the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which separates nuclear and electronic motion, and the establishment of the molecular
Hamiltonian through the synergy of Quantum Mechanics and Classical Electromagnetism.1,2 We detail how
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics provide the critical link between microscopic quantum states and
macroscopic observables via the partition function.3 The review further examines the mandatory incorporation
of Relativity for heavy elements, governed by the Dirac equation, and the formal power of Quantum Field
Theory, which provides the second quantization formalism underpinning high-accuracy methods like Coupled
Cluster theory.4,5 Finally, we explore the emerging frontier of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in chemistry,
where the electromagnetic field itself is quantized.6 The discussion is framed by the central trade-off between
the rigorous inclusion of physical effects—from electron correlation to relativistic and QED corrections—and
the associated computational cost. This synthesis demonstrates that the ongoing evolution of ab initio methods is a systematic effort to replace convenience-driven classical approximations with rigorous, unified physical theories, thereby extending the domain of the first-principles prediction.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational,2025-11-11T12:41:23.598Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690be2bea482cba122555a35/original/mapping-ab-initio-physical-theories-to-computational-chemistry-methods-the-contributions-of-classical-mechanics-thermodynamics-and-statistical-mechanics-electromagnetism-relativity-quantum-mechanics-and-quantum-field-theory.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0pw68,Comparative Study on the Catalytic Activity of [CoIII4O4] Heterocubanes in Alcohol Oxidation Reactions in Solution,"We report a comparative study on the catalytic oxidation of 2-propanol (i-PrOH), benzyl alcohol (BnOH), and cinnamyl alcohol (CnOH) in solution under moderate reaction conditions (65 °C ‒ 150 °C) using two tetranuclear CoIII-oxo complexes [Co4O4(O2CR)4(py)4] (R = Me 1, Et 2, py = pyridine) and three oxidants (O2, H2O2, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)). TBHP was identified as the most active oxidant, resulting in turnover frequency (TOF) values ranging from 40 to 100 h‒1. The slightly larger carboxylate ligand in complex 2 favored aldehyde selectivities of the reactions but with lower conversion rates. Kinetic studies showed a second-order rate law, and mechanistic investigation confirmed the active participation of intermediately formed radicals in these oxidation reactions, since the alcohols were not oxidized in the presence of hydroquinone (radical scavenger). Quantum chemical calculations fully agreed with experimental observations, demonstrating that the catalytic oxidation reactions are initiated via Haber-Weiss activation of TBHP, resulting in the formation of tert-butyl peroxyl radicals (t-BuOO·), and simultaneous reduction of CoIII to CoII.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Catalysis; Kinetics and Mechanism - Inorganic Reactions; Theory - Computational; Homogeneous Catalysis,2025-11-11T05:58:29.111Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690a3659a482cba12201f02c/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690a3164ef936fb4a24dd39a/original/comparative-study-on-the-catalytic-activity-of-co-iii4o4-heterocubanes-in-alcohol-oxidation-reactions-in-solution.pdf

Both 1-electron and 2-electron SOC integrals are computed using Breit-Pauli and
Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonians in the atomic mean-field approximation. SO-L-PDFT removes the unphysical the J-symmetry breaking observed in MC-PDFT.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-s6k1m-v2,Influence of Intrinsic Electric Fields and 2-His-1-Carboxylate/Chloride Facial Triad on the Active Sites of 2-Oxoglutarate–Dependent Enzymes ,"Iron (II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (Fe(II)/2OG) oxygenases form a large family of non-heme enzymes containing the Fe(II) center coordinated by two histidine residues and either a carboxylate or halide ligand, with 2OG acting as a co-substrate. Although these enzymes share a conserved 2-His-1-carboxylate/halide motif in their active sites, they catalyze a wide variety of oxidative chemical reactions. We here investigate two factors that can significantly impact the divergence in their observed catalytic functions, namely, the intrinsic electric field (IEF) exerted on the active site by the surrounding protein environment, and variations of the composition of the facial triad. Concretely, we first evaluate the IEFs in Fe(II)/2OG oxygenases and investigate whether the direction and magnitude of these computed IEFs correlate with catalytic function across multiple subfamilies of Fe(II)/2OG oxygenases. We also examine how these IEFs can influence the geometric and electronic structures of Fe(III)-superoxo intermediates formed in the active site of Fe(II)/2OG oxygenases upon binding O2, the initial step of their oxidative catalytic cycles. Additionally, we evaluated how the identity and orientation of the third ligand (Glu, Asp, or Cl) in the 2-His-1-carboxylate/halide facial triad influence the active site complexes. Our findings suggest that specific steps in the catalytic cycle are determined by the interplay between the IEF due to the protein environment and the structural features of the facial triad. The results of this study provide insights into the role of IEFs and the facial triads in the observed reaction specificity of different Fe(II)/2OG enzymes.
