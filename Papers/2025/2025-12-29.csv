10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kdvrt,ChemTSv3: Generalizing Molecular Design via Flexible Search Space Control,"Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have enabled in silico molecular design to become a powerful approach for exploring chemical space toward specific design goals across various domains. However, in actual design workflows, determining the appropriate generation conditions, including generative strategies and reward formulations, remains difficult; thus, trial-and-error adjustments are unavoidable. Yet, most existing generation methods implicitly fix the searchable chemical space defined by the molecular representation and generation method, which significantly limits the flexibility of practical design.  This paper introduces ChemTSv3, an exploration framework based on reinforcement learning with a flexible architecture that accommodates diverse design scenarios for adaptive molecular design.  Specifically, molecular representations are unified as nodes, enabling, for example, string-based encodings, molecular graphs, and protein sequences to be handled within the same logic.  Molecular generations and editing operations are abstracted as transitions between nodes, allowing classical graph-based modifications, sequential mutations, and even large-language-model-driven transformations to be handled within the same formulation. ChemTSv3 supports dynamic switching among molecular representations and transition types, which enables the search strategy itself to adapt to the stage and nature of the design task.   ChemTSv3 enables scalable molecular generation, from drug-like small molecules to proteins, and its switching capability supports realistic change in design scenarios while allowing efficient exploration.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Materials Chemistry,2025-12-28T03:51:48.245Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/694379e1e3cb457e134efece/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/694351546e8e74030e1a66c4/original/chem-t-sv3-generalizing-molecular-design-via-flexible-search-space-control.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-r6h31,DAR-GNN: Dynamic Anchor Relational Graph Neural Network for Efficient ADMET Property Prediction with Left-Censored Labels,"ADMET property prediction is crucial for drug discovery yet severely hindered by left-censored labels in experimental datasets, which introduce significant prediction bias in standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While relational learning approaches, such as Bilinear Transduction, address this by focusing on property differences, they suffer from substantial computational overhead and deployment complexity due to their reliance on fixed anchor molecules. We propose the Dynamic Anchor Relational Graph Neural Network (DAR-GNN), a novel end-to-end architecture that integrates dynamic anchor generation and relational difference learning. DAR-GNN employs a Dynamic Anchor Generation Module that adaptively synthesizes a context-aware dynamic anchor representation from a learnable virtual anchor pool via an attention mechanism. This dynamic anchor facilitates a difference-aware prediction of the target property. Extensive experiments on diverse ADMET datasets, including challenging temporal splits with varying levels of censoring, demonstrate that DAR-GNN consistently outperforms traditional GNN baselines and achieves comparable or superior predictive performance to Bilinear Transduction, while offering significantly enhanced computational efficiency and improved generalization capabilities. Our work provides a scalable and robust solution for ADMET property prediction, particularly for datasets plagued by censored labels, thereby accelerating early-stage drug discovery.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-12-28T03:44:53.757Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6942fde96e8e74030e0c4d49/original/dar-gnn-dynamic-anchor-relational-graph-neural-network-for-efficient-admet-property-prediction-with-left-censored-labels.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vmr1q-v2,RxnNet: An AI Framework for Reaction Mechanism Discovery - A Case Study of Carbocations,"Understanding complex chemical reaction cascades remains a major challenge in chemistry. Scalable investigation of their thermodynamic and kinetic properties requires the use of automated reaction prediction tools, which is a rapidly growing area in the study of chemical reactivity. However, the systematic exploration of intricate reaction networks involving highly reactive intermediates continues to pose significant difficulties. Here, we introduce RxnNet, a novel artificial intelligence-assisted platform for the automated prediction of chemical reaction mechanisms. RxnNet integrates heuristic rules with domain-specific chemical knowledge including stereochemistry, regiochemistry, conformational preferences, and isotope labeling, to construct mechanistically informed reaction networks. These networks are represented as graphs and are coupled with on-the-fly quantum chemical evaluations to identify all feasible intermediates and transition states. In this work, we apply RxnNet to carbocation chemistry, a notoriously complex and computationally demanding type of reaction. We demonstrate the method’s capabilities by analyzing three multistep reactions with known mechanisms, each of which poses significant challenges even for expert computational and synthetic chemists. RxnNet provides a robust approach for uncovering reaction mechanisms, which can accelerate the understanding and design of transformations in complex chemical systems.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-9gd3c,Large-scale structure- and sequence-based comparative analysis enables functional annotation of animal venom peptides,"Animal venoms constitute one of the most chemically diverse and pharmacologically rich peptide repertoires in nature, yet the vast majority of venom peptides remain structurally and functionally unannotated due to limited material availability and a paucity of experimentally solved structures. This knowledge gap has significantly constrained both mechanistic understanding and translational applications of venom-derived molecules. Here we conduct a comprehensive structure- and sequence-based comparative analysis of close to 4,000 venom peptides (i.e. teretoxins and conotoxins) from marine snails using AlphaFold2. While conotoxins have been studied for over six decades, teretoxins remain largely unexplored. Our study provides the first comprehensive structural classification and functional annotation of the entire known teretoxin repertoire, substantially expanding the venom peptide landscape. Structural clustering analysis revealed that both teretoxins and conotoxins form a large number of structural clusters (225 and 307 clusters, respectively), with each cluster characterized by conserved cysteine frameworks and disulfide connectivity. Importantly, combining structural clusters with phylogenetic analysis revealed that structure prediction together with cysteine frameworks offer an improved strategy for venom peptide classification. We used predicted disulfide connectivity from derived from AlphaFold2 models to annotate the majority of uncharacterized conotoxins on ConoServer database, addressing a long-standing classification bottleneck in venom peptide classification efforts. As a concrete demonstration of functional prediction, co-clustering of predicted teretoxin and conotoxin structures led to the identification of teretoxins structurally homologous to conotoxins with described activities, suggesting shared functional activities such as Kunitz-type peptide activity, neurotoxicity, and ion channel inhibition. Using docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on our Kunitz-type peptide co-cluster, we observed that conotoxin P07849 and teretoxin Tar2.9 engage trypsin in a manner similar to the Kunitz Domain 1 (KD1) of the Alzheimer’s amyloid beta-protein precursor (APPI), a previously unappreciated protease inhibitory role for this venom peptide family. Overall, this work establishes a scalable, structure-centric framework that combines structure prediction, structural clustering, co-clustering, and phylogenetics for deorphanizing venom peptides, enabling predicted annotation and functional inference for future experimental, pharmacological, and therapeutic exploration.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Chemical Biology; Artificial Intelligence,2025-12-22T16:28:31.431Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary File 1: ConoServer updated framework and connectivity', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6940cba708e316a05f0552be/original/supplementary-file-1-cono-server-updated-framework-and-connectivity.xlsx'}, {'title': 'Supplementary File 2: Teretoxin Framework and Connectivity Classification', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6940cc0508e316a05f055e6e/original/supplementary-file-2-teretoxin-framework-and-connectivity-classification.xlsx'}, {'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6940cc3908e316a05f0565b0/original/supplementary-information.docx'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6940bf0408e316a05f0380b8/original/large-scale-structure-and-sequence-based-comparative-analysis-enables-functional-annotation-of-animal-venom-peptides.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-pmnmb,The Impact of Reward Scalarization and Weight Scheduling on Optimization Dynamics in Multi-Objective Molecular Design,"Inverse molecular design aims to generate novel chemical structures that satisfy multiple property constraints, yet reinforcement-learning (RL) fine-tuning can be sensitive to how objectives are converted into a scalar reward. Here, we systematically analyze how scalarization choices and stabilization mechanisms shape optimization dynamics in REINVENT-based RL fine-tuning for multi-parameter optimization (MPO).  Using policy gradient techniques such as REINVENT, we evaluate three scalarization schemes—linear (sum), geometric (product), and Chebyshev-type—under multiple target regimes that vary in constraint tightness and prior support. While broad targets yield stable behavior across scalarizations, narrow and weakly supported targets expose sharp failure modes. We further show that target-aware weight scheduling accelerates hypervolume growth and can rescue collapse regimes. Finally, entropy regularization provides an orthogonal safeguard but only in specific cases.   Collectively, our results highlight critical interactions between scalarization choice and weight dynamics, and provide mechanistic insight and actionable guidance for stabilizing RL fine-tuning in constrained molecular MPO.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-12-22T15:52:43.520Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69402d7cef27c95d3b56234a/original/the-impact-of-reward-scalarization-and-weight-scheduling-on-optimization-dynamics-in-multi-objective-molecular-design.pdf

Traditional materials development pipelines typically require 10-20 years, but self-driving laboratories (SDLs) and Materials Acceleration Platforms (MAPs) aim to reduce this to 1-2 years through closed-loop systems combining physical experimentation with computational intelligence. The review analyzes critical components including robotic hardware architectures, integrated analytical instrumentation, closed-loop optimization strategies, AI-driven decision-making frameworks, and multi-agent systems for laboratory coordination. Case studies demonstrate remarkable success across various domains: nanomaterials synthesis, inorganic materials exploration, electrocatalyst discovery, and reaction mechanism elucidation. Large language models have recently enhanced these systems by improving knowledge extraction, experimental planning, and multi-agent coordination. The integration of standardized data formats, accessible materials databases, and sophisticated knowledge representation frameworks further accelerates discovery while enhancing reproducibility.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-gc17t-v2,PoroNet: An Intrinsically Interpretable Pore Graph Neural Network for Resolving Pore-Level Adsorption in Metal-Organic Frameworks,"Machine learning (ML) models have been widely used as efficient surrogates to predict adsorption in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), for gas storage, chemical separations, and catalysis applications. The “black box” nature of these ML models, however, remains a significant barrier between predictions and the design of novel MOFs. In this work, we introduce PoroNet, an intrinsically interpretable graph neural network architecture built on a graph representation of the pore network (i.e., pore graph). In a pore graph, nodes represent individual pores and edges represent pore connections. PoroNet shows highly accurate predictions of hydrogen (H2) uptake and deliverable capacity in MOFs, as well as on a benchmark simulated adsorption dataset that contains spherical and linear alkane adsorbates. More importantly, accurate pore-level contributions to total adsorption can be learned using PoroNet either through direct supervised learning or as latent representations while fitting the total adsorption capacity. In direct supervised learning with explicit pore-level labels, we show that PoroNet architecture is data-efficient, achieving comparable performance to the standard approach with only a fraction of simulation runs needed for model training. The pore-level contribution helps interpret the ML predictions of the total adsorption behavior, identify the key pore properties that govern the adsorption, and provide significant insights into pore engineering. We demonstrate that PoroNet is a powerful tool for high-throughput pore screening and for deriving valuable MOF design rules for cryogenic H2 storage applications.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rq1vl-v7,Large-Scale Virtual Screening Identifies Novel Allosteric Modulators of TIMP2: A Computational Approach to Enhancing Neuroplasticity,"TIMP2 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2) plays a crucial role in hippocampal neuroplasticity and cognitive function through MMP-independent signaling. Despite its therapeutic promise, TIMP2 has long been considered 'undruggable' due to its cryptic surface topology and lack of canonical active sites. We present a comprehensive computational pipeline integrating CNS-filtered virtual screening, orthogonal ADMET/toxicity validation, and allosteric site targeting to identify small-molecule modulators of TIMP2. Screening ~600,000 CNS-filtered compounds from ZINC20 against a cryptic N-terminal allosteric site (Val6, Leu100, Phe103) identified 178 compounds with favorable drug-like properties. Orthogonal validation using ProTox-III refined this to 154 highest-confidence candidates (Tier 1A) validated across multiple computational toxicology platforms. Site selectivity analysis revealed 99.5% preference for the primary allosteric pocket, establishing it as the dominant binding site for therapeutic intervention. Chemical diversity analysis identified 15 distinct scaffold families spanning both halogenated (26.6%) and non-halogenated (73.4%) chemotypes, demonstrating multiple viable strategies for achieving CNS penetration with clean safety profiles.

We introduce Trans-pair Relations Expression (T-REX), a canonical notation that encodes coordination geometry via trans-pair maps. Validating T-REX on the previously published datasets reveals a stark geometric blind spot in experimental data: while our enumeration identifies over 20,000 additional accessible coordination isomers (expanding the topological space by ~200%), the original dataset contained only 72 resolved diastereomeric pairs. Beyond geometric enumeration, T-REX enables massive chemical space exploration through modular ligand substitution; applying this method to a seed set of 658 metal hydrides generates 2.3 million chemically plausible candidates.

By combining basic dimensionality reduction techniques with a state-of-the art approximation of the Koopman operator associated to molecular dynamics simulations (MD), we show that these states and transitions can be analyzed very efficiently based on MD simulation data. To construct the Koopman approximation, we employ a kernel-based method and solve the associated matrix equations using random Fourier features, leading to accurate solutions while maintaining low computational effort.

While QCT has traditionally been applied on a molecule-by-molecule basis, recent advances in machine learning (ML) and the availability of large quantum chemical datasets now enable bonding analysis at scale. Here, we integrate ELF-based topological descriptors with ML to establish a data-driven framework for mapping chemical bonding across the QM9 dataset. Wavefunctions computed at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level were used to extract ELF basin populations, which were paired with geometric and bonding descriptors to construct a bond-level dataset. Statistical analysis revealed relationships between ELF populations, bond lengths, and local chemical environments. Regression models were trained to predict ELF electron populations directly from molecular geometry. The best performance was obtained when local environmental descriptors were included, reducing the prediction error by a factor of two relative to models using only bond type and bond length. These results demonstrate real-space bonding parameters, such as bond electron populations, can be predicted from simple structural features, enabling scalable and interpretable exploration of chemical bonding across large chemical spaces.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning,2025-12-28T01:52:32.189Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6942c54ee3cb457e13335003/original/machine-learning-the-quantum-topology-of-chemical-bonds.pdf

Recent discoveries of numerous second-generation ligands for Cu-mediated Ullmann-type cross-coupling reactions have broadened the scope to include less reactive aryl halides and nucleophiles and have also enabled lower copper and ligand loadings in these processes. However, in contrast to Pd chemistry, in-silico workflows for guiding systematic ligand selection from early-stage screening through optimization remain significantly less developed for Cu-catalyzed C-O and C-N bond coupling reactions. This report describes the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for streamlining ligand selection in Cu-catalyzed Ullmann-type coupling reactions. It provides a “map” of more than 80 ligands used in Ullmann couplings and is designed to reveal reactivity trends and highlight areas of high and low yields, thereby facilitating prioritization of high-value experiments in both medicinal and process chemistry settings.

Recent studies have assayed and published the raw fluorescent values of  Cy3 and Cy5 as a function of the most adjacent 5 nucleotides resulting in 1024 data points. While experimentally tractable, an increase in the sequence space will vastly increase the experimental and time cost. Machine Learning is well suited to addressing the issue of experimental tractability however there is a wide design space in the choice of algorithms. In this work we use classic machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptrons and Random Forests to both predict the raw intensity value and classify the intensity magnitude of the fluorophore using the sequence as input.

This perspective argues that time-dependent structural change is a crucial, but often overlooked, mechanistic feature as many reactions simply do not follow a single, equilibrated minimum-energy path. We highlight examples where traditional transition state theory fails, typically cases involving short-lived interme-diates, non-equilibrium solvation, momentum-controlled selectivity, post-transition state bifurcations, and “hidden” dy-namic intermediates and show how molecular dynamics can reveal the actual sequence of structural change which gov-erns a reaction outcome. We also discuss emerging machine learning-based molecular dynamics which have found appli-cations in photochemistry and solvent modelling. While molecular dynamics will not replace methods based on transi-tion state theory, it offers organic chemists a time-resolved view of molecular structure which can be crucial to under-standing a given reaction.

Herein, we report a broadly applicable and easy to use machine learning algorithm, ScopeBO, for the selection of scopes that balance these two aspects. We use the Vendi score as a metric for scope diversity and establish a scope score that quantifies scope performance within the context of a specific chemical search space. The hyperparameters of ScopeBO are optimized using these metrics, and its performance is validated with several reaction datasets, demonstrating favorable performance against that of alternative selection methods.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-cq92m,Multi-Objective Catalyst Discovery in High-Entropy Alloy Composition Space: The Role of Noble Metals on the Pareto Front for Oxygen Reduction Reaction,"Discovering new materials for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions is a key step toward energy sustainability. However, for catalysts to be viable in practice, they must perform in multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. We demonstrate this challenge for the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), where activity, stability, and material cost must be balanced. Using the continuous composition space of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) together with our established models for activity and dissolution, we identify a Pareto-optimal set of ORR catalysts within the Ag–Au–Cu–Ir–Pd–Pt–Rh–Ru system via multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Additionally, we introduce a fine-tuned machine learning model that predicts adsorption energies for alloys spanning 12 elements and 9 adsorbates.  Our results show that alloying expands the hypervolume spanned by the Pareto front, consisting of low- to medium-entropy alloys composed primarily of Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, and Pt. We further propose an approach for analyzing the Pareto front by quantifying the loss in hypervolume when critical elements (Au, Pd, and Pt) are removed, clarifying their relative contributions to optimal performance.  This work highlights the need to consider all relevant objectives in catalyst optimization and the advantage of HEAs as a powerful platform for multi-objective catalyst discovery.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vk805,Challenges and Opportunities of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials in Heterogeneous Catalysis,"The design of novel catalysts gets the fundamental rational on accurate and efficient modeling of reactivity on surfaces and materials. To reach this detailed atomistic understanding density functional theory (DFT) has been the key computational technique. However, the emergence of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) marks a significant paradigm shift, offering the potential to match DFT accuracy at drastically reduced computational cost. This perspective provides an overview of state-of-the-art MLIPs for heterogeneous catalysis as ""out-of-the-box"" tools. We summarize the different families of MLIPs and their trainings, and then apply to heterogeneous catalysis problems. Furthermore, we critically address the challenges of model transferability and integration in unified frameworks, underscoring the necessity for standardized protocols to benchmark performance across different architectures. Finally, we assess the capacity of pre-trained models to democratize computational catalysis, highlighting the specific hurdles that remain in achieving reliable, predictive power for widespread use.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry,2025-12-22T10:07:06.431Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information: Challenges and Opportunities of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials in Heterogeneous Catalysis', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/693db397ef27c95d3bd1b554/original/supplementary-information-challenges-and-opportunities-of-machine-learning-interatomic-potentials-in-heterogeneous-catalysis.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/693db10508e316a05f62c874/original/challenges-and-opportunities-of-machine-learning-interatomic-potentials-in-heterogeneous-catalysis.pdf

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mgngb,Extending QM/GEM Capabilities: Geometry Optimization and Multipoles Applied to Molecular Cooperativity Studies.,"Hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods have become a powerful tool for simulating complex molecular systems, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The embedding of the QM wavefunction in the MM environment can be implemented in several ways, with electrostatic embedding being one of the most popular approaches. Inclusion of mutual polarization resulting in polarizable QM/MM has gained popularity. We recently introduced an implementation of the Gaussian Electrostatic Model (GEM) for QM/MM simulations. This advancement enables the direct integration of polarizable density-based embedding, and inclusion of explicit exchange embedding, enhancing the precision and versatility of QM/MM simulations. In our previous implementation, QM/GEM was limited to single-point calculations. In this contribution, we present the implementation and validation of analytic energy gradients within the QM/GEM framework. The inclusion of analytical gradients now enables geometry optimizations, opening up a wide range of applications such as the exploration of reaction coordinates, refinement of active site geometries in enzymes, and enhanced conformational sampling in large molecular assemblies. We also extend our QM/GEM implementation to incorporate higher-order multipole expansions for representing the QM region in polarization calculations. We applied our QM/GEM implementation to investigate cooperativity phenomena in water clusters. While previous studies have shown that classical force fields can qualitatively capture cooperativity trends, our results demonstrate that QM/GEM provides improved quantitative accuracy. The method closely reproduces high-level quantum chemical benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational,2025-12-22T05:04:45.180Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/693c82dcef27c95d3b93d4cf/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/693c80b6ef27c95d3b925a96/original/extending-qm-gem-capabilities-geometry-optimization-and-multipoles-applied-to-molecular-cooperativity-studies.pdf
