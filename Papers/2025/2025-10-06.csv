10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-4h5k9,LLM-Based AI Agents for Automated Data Extraction of Material Properties and Structural Features,"The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large, machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural context. Existing databases are either limited in scale, manually curated, or biased toward idealized first principles results, leaving experimental literature underexploited. Here we present
an agentic, large language model (LLM) driven workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural properties from ∼10,000 full-text scientific articles. The system integrates dynamic token allocation, zero-shot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on a manually curated set of 50 papers shows that GPT-4.1
achieves the highest extraction accuracy (F1 ≈ 0.91 for thermoelectric properties, F1 ≈ 0.838 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1 Mini offers nearly comparable performance (F1 ≈ 0.889 for thermoelectric, F1 ≈ 0.833 for structural) at a fraction of the cost, enabling large-scale deployment. Applying this workflow, we create a data set of 27,822 property temperature records with normalized units, spanning the figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. To facilitate community access, we release an interactive web explorer supporting semantic filters, numeric queries, and CSV export. Together, this study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and establishes a foundation for scalable and data-driven thermoelectric material discovery. The workflow is broadly generalizable and can be adapted to curate structure-property datasets across diverse classes of functional materials beyond thermoelectrics.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-10-01T20:10:06.564Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d91bdaf2aff16770f6d870/original/llm-based-ai-agents-for-automated-data-extraction-of-material-properties-and-structural-features.pdf

However, the interface of newly developed machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with existing computational chemistry workflows based on quantum mechanics (QM) remains a challenge. Here, we introduce ChemRefine as a modular automated computational chemistry platform that enables researchers to seamlessly integrate the next generation of MLIPs into their computational workflows. We road-test ChemRefine on multiple computational tasks commonly encountered by researchers, including conformational sampling, host–guest binding, redox and photophysical property prediction, transition state finding, molecular dynamics spawning, and the creation of optimal microsolvation ensembles. We also introduce a feature that enables automatic training/fine-tuning and deployment of MLIPs during workflows, enabling computational chemists to accelerate their simulations while maintaining prediction accuracy. To simplify the use of ChemRefine, we also introduce a custom large language model, ChemRefineGPT, that generates all required input and configuration files based on a natural language description of the desired workflow.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-09-30T08:12:59.186Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information (PDF)', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d5e95cf2aff167709d769e/original/supporting-information-pdf.pdf'}, {'title': 'Supporting Data (ZIP)', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d5e9cef41630377066e2aa/original/supporting-data-zip.zip'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d17e0e3e708a7649acb190/original/chem-refine-an-open-source-automated-and-interoperable-platform-for-machine-learning-and-quantum-chemistry-simulations.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-8rw8j,DEL Simulator: A Digital Twin for Understanding Machine Learning on DNA-Encoded Libraries,"DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) are a powerful way to find chemical starting points against challenging biological targets, by rapidly generating billion-scale structure-activity datasets. However, DEL experiment design and interpretation, especially the optimal use of machine learning (ML) to analyse the vast amount of generated data or to screen large external purchasable datasets, remain poorly understood. To address these challenges, we report the development of a digital twin – an in-silico DEL simulator – that models the underlying chemistry and selection processes of typical experiments as a function of key design parameters, including read count, cycles of selection, one-step reaction yield, and library size. We systematically investigate how these design parameters influence downstream ML virtual screening and identify specific regimes where the choice to apply preprocessing steps such as disynthon aggregation can significantly enhance screening performance. In addition, we show that increasing library size can degrade ML-based screening performance. Our simulator provides a statistically principled way to understand and analyse DEL experiments via an interpretable model for DEL data generation.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-10-02T21:25:25.228Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68db15863e708a7649d6ce8c/original/del-simulator-a-digital-twin-for-understanding-machine-learning-on-dna-encoded-libraries.pdf

Here we introduce a reactive machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) framework that bridges quantum chemistry with long-timescale sampling, enabling direct exploration of enzymatic transition states and free-energy landscapes. Coupled with metadynamics, this approach achieves nanosecond sampling of bond-forming reactions and quantitatively predicts activation barriers, mutational effects, and stereoselectivity. Applied to Diels–Alderases, the framework not only reproduces experimental activity andendo/exo preferences with sub-kcal/mol accuracy but also uncovers how pathway dynamics and local electrostatics preorganize substrates for selective outcomes. By uniting reactivity, conformational dynamics, and predictive power, this work establishes reactive ML/MM as a broadly applicable strategy for mechanistic enzymology and a foundation for the rational design of new biocatalysts.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning,2025-10-02T21:17:10.527Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68db245e3e708a7649d7e0c6/original/redefining-computational-enzymology-with-multiscale-machine-learning-molecular-mechanics-metadynamics-deciphering-catalytic-mechanism-and-stereoselectivity-in-diels-alderases.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1vnp0,"FAME 3R: A Fast, Compact, Flexible, and Practical Re-Design of the FAME 3 Model for Predicting Sites of Metabolism","Predicting sites of metabolism (SOMs), i.e., the atom positions in a molecule where metabolic reactions are initiated, is an important component of the computational development pipeline for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and cosmetics. Among the available SOM prediction models, FAME 3, published in 2019, stands out as one of the few noncommercial tools capable of predicting both phase 1 and phase 2 SOMs for a diverse set of xenobiotics. However, significant challenges remained with the original implementation of FAME 3, particularly in terms of maintainability, scalability, and interoperability with other tools, which hindered its broader adoption and long-term usability. To address these shortcomings, we developed FAME 3R, an improved version of FAME 3. Built on Python’s robust data science ecosystem, FAME 3R delivers improved computational efficiency, scalability for larger datasets, and seamless interoperability with contemporary tools. In addition to re-implementing the core functionalities of FAME 3, FAME 3R introduces new features, including support for training models on a broader range of fingerprints and a novel method for assessing prediction reliability using Shannon entropy. FAME 3R is available as an open-source Python package, offering access to all functionalities via an application programming interface (API) and command-line tools.

We present DiffPharm, a diffusion-based framework that embeds explicit pharmacophore control into the generative process. Unlike previous models, 3D pharmacophore models are encoded as pharmacophore graphs and utilized as constraints injected into an equivariant transformer architecture during the denoising process. This design enables not only maintaining good pharmacophore alignment for generated conformations but also a unique inpainting capability, allowing structure generation under both substructure and pharmacophore constraints. Our benchmark studies show that DiffPharm can efficiently generate structurally diverse and drug-like molecules that achieve superior pharmacophore match scores as well as docking scores compared to existing methods.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-d1v7v,CACHE Challenge #3: Targeting the Nsp3 Macrodomain of SARS-CoV-2,"The third Critical Assessment of Computational Hit-finding Experiments (CACHE) challenged computational teams to identify chemically novel ligands targeting the macrodomain 1 of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3, a promising coronavirus drug target. Twenty-three groups deployed diverse design strategies to collectively select 1739 ligand candidates. While over 85% of the designed molecules were chemically novel, the best experimentally confirmed hits were structurally similar to previously published compounds. Confirming a trend observed in CACHE #1 and #2, two of the best-performing workflows used compounds selected by physics-based computational screening methods to train machine learning models able to rapidly screen large chemical libraries, while four others used exclusively physics-based approaches. Three pharmacophore searches and one fragment growing strategy were also part of the seven winning workflows. While active molecules discovered by CACHE #3 participants largely mimicked the adenine ring of the endogenous substrate, ADP-ribose, preserving the canonical chemotype commonly observed in previously reported Nsp3-Mac1 ligands, they still provide novel structure-activity relationship insights that may inform the development of future antivirals.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-4vmx6,Reactivity of Nanoconfined Water is Modulated by the Properties of Confining Materials,"The autoionization of water, a fundamental process in aqueous chemistry, is profoundly altered under nanoconfinement. The properties of the confining material determine the layer dependence of autoionization, dictating whether reactions are stabilized at the interface or in the subsurface. In weakly interacting walls (Wall A), hydroxide is destabilized at the interface and the reaction proceeds preferentially in the subsurface, whereas in strongly interacting walls (Wall B) the interfacial and subsurface states are nearly isoenergetic, reducing selectivity. This contrast arises from confinement-enforced coordination motifs where hydronium remains tri-coordinated across environments, while hydroxide is restricted to tetra coordination at the interface but adopts hypercoordinated states in the subsurface. Mechanical flexibility of the confining framework further modulates the overall thermodynamics by reducing the entropic penalty, as water molecules can explore a broader configurational space compared to rigid pores. These findings establish how layer-specific solvation and wall flexibility govern confined-water reactivity, providing molecular-level design principles for engineering dynamic nanoscale interfaces in catalysis, energy storage, and molecular separations.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Physical and Chemical Properties,2025-09-30T20:44:39.760Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d886cbf2aff16770e93c54/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d88478f416303770accdd2/original/reactivity-of-nanoconfined-water-is-modulated-by-the-properties-of-confining-materials.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bkm2m,Decoupling Complex Cell Aging with Explainable Machine Learning: A Perspective,"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) undergo irreversible and complex aging processes, making it essential to understand the influence of cycling parameters on their State of Health (SOH). Although previous aging studies have systematically varied cycling parameters to assess battery lifetime, the relative importance of these parameters on degradation mechanism with declining SOH is not well characterized. In this perspective, we apply explainable machine learning to a publicly available dataset of 28 LIBs to quantify the contributions of key cycling parameters on degradation as a function of SOH. Our analysis reveals that in the early stages of life (SOH 1.00 - 0.90), degradation is primarily governed by temperature, likely due to the abundance of available electrolyte. At later stages (SOH 0.875 - 0.80), charging current emerges as the dominant driver, reflecting the growth of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI), electrolyte depletion, and associated effects such as Joule heating. These stage-dependent findings align with prior mechanistic studies and demonstrate how combining small-data ML with interpretability can yield new insights into degradation pathways. Overall, this work provides a qualitative framework for linking cycling parameters with SOH-dependent degradation, offering guidance for strategies to extend the cycle life and safety of LIBs.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-n9gpr-v2,Enhanced Thermophysical Property Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification using Group Contribution- Gaussian Process Regression,"Group contribution (GC) models are powerful, simple, and popular methods for property prediction.
However, the most accessible and computationally efficient GC methods, like the Joback and Reid
(JR) GC models, often exhibit severe systematic bias. Furthermore, most GC methods do not
have uncertainty estimates associated with their predictions. The present work develops a hybrid
method for property prediction that integrates GC models with Gaussian process (GP) regression.
Predictions from the JR GC method, along with the molecular weight, are used as input features
to the GP models, which learn and correct the systematic biases in the GC predictions, resulting in
highly accurate property predictions with reliable uncertainty estimates. The method was applied
to six properties: normal boiling temperature (Tb), enthalpy of vaporization at Tb (ΔHvap), normal
melting temperature (Tm), critical pressure (Pc), critical molar volume (Vc), and critical temperature
(Tc). The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics was used as the primary source of experimental
data. The final collected experimental data ranged from 485 molecules for ΔHvap to 5640 for Tm.
The proposed GCGP method significantly improved property prediction accuracy compared to the
GC-only method. The coefficient of determination (R2) values of the testing set predictions are ≥
0.85 for five out of six and ≥ 0.90 for four out of six properties modeled, and compare favorably with
other methods in the literature. Tm was used to demonstrate one way the GCGP method can be tuned
for even better predictive accuracy. The GCGP method provides reliable uncertainty estimates and
computational efficiency for making new predictions. The GCGP method proved robust to variations
in GP model architecture and kernel choice.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-09-30T04:51:18.672Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information for: Enhanced Thermophysical Property Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification us- ing Group Contribution-Gaussian Process Regression', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d4dbb73e708a7649204b03/original/supporting-information-for-enhanced-thermophysical-property-prediction-with-uncertainty-quantification-us-ing-group-contribution-gaussian-process-regression.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d4dbb73e708a7649204af6/original/enhanced-thermophysical-property-prediction-with-uncertainty-quantification-using-group-contribution-gaussian-process-regression.pdf

This study demonstrates that pesticide vapour pressures can be predicted (77.1% and 83.3% within one order of magnitude) using kernel ridge regression (krr) and XGBoost on quantum chemical molecular properties but the model lacks easy interpretability. However, insights (via Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)) can be gained when a framework of functional groups is employed instead. Functional group-based models (krr: 66.7% within one order of magnitude) reveal that aromatic compounds, sulfonic acid derivatives, and carboxylic acid derivatives influence the vapour pressure the most. SHAP value trends indicate a linear relationship between reduced vapour pressure and the frequency of functional groups.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jsxvv,First Principles and Machine Learning-based Analysis of Sulfur Poisoning of High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts,"Mitigation of sulfur poisoning of transition metal catalysts remains a significant challenge for many thermally-driven heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Recently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs), a class of multimetallic alloys having a disordered structure, have emerged as highly stable catalysts for a diverse set of reactions. They typically consist of greater than four elements, allowing for greater tunability as compared to conventional bimetallic alloys. HEA catalysts are, therefore, promising candidates for the mitigation of sulfur poisoning. However, the combinatorial space of these multimetallic alloys is exceedingly complex, and therefore, comprehensive experimental investigation of all candidate HEAs, or computational design of HEAs using exclusively using first principles methods, is infeasible. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework that combines Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and a machine learning model (SlabGCN) to simultaneously predict sulfur adsorption energies and surface energies of binary, ternary, and quaternary alloys comprised of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Cu. Rapid screening of diverse surface structures and varying sulfur coverages using this framework permits construction of detailed surface phase diagrams at arbitrary compositions that elucidate evolution of sulfur poisoning as a function of reaction conditions. We explicitly study the influence of sulfur-induced surface segregation on HEA surface stability, which has not been previously explored, and we demonstrate that this influence decreases as the number of elements increases. Lastly, we illustrate an optimization workflow that can be used to discover more sulfur tolerant alloys, and we discuss potential applications of the broader computational framework in studying more complex chemistries on high-entropy alloys.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry,2025-09-29T11:33:07.574Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d3ffaff4163037702bab25/original/supplementary-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d3fcdaf4163037702b6371/original/first-principles-and-machine-learning-based-analysis-of-sulfur-poisoning-of-high-entropy-alloy-catalysts.pdf

Lanthanide coordination geometries are driven by intra-ligand constraints and inter-ligand repulsion. Studies on inter-ligand restraints are largely limited to the lanthanide contraction and the ‘Gadolinium Break’. In this work, we expand on inter-ligand restraints in a series of lanthanides, from large (La3+) to small (Yb3+), and solvents from small (H2O) to bulky (tBuOH) by means of X-ray total scattering, density-functional theory (DFT), optical spectroscopy and multiconfigurational computational methods. We find from X-ray total scattering that the average Ln-O bond distance in [Ln(solv)n]3+ (Ln = La, Nd, Eu, Tb, Yb; solv = H2O, MeOH, EtOH, iPrOH, tBuOH; n = 7, 8, 9), decreases as the lanthanide ionic radii decreases, but remains constant as the solvent bulk is increased. This is rationalized via DFT by a decrease in coordination number counteracting the inherent increase in Ln-O bond distance as solvent bulk is increased, resulting in no changes in the average Ln-O bond distance being observed in experiment. These results are confirmed by qualitative shifts in spectral shape from absorption and luminescence spectroscopy and by direct comparison with simulated optical spectra for Yb3+.
