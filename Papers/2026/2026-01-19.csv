10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-83634,EvoDiffMol: Evolutionary Diffusion Framework for 3D Molecular Design with Optimized Properties,"Designing molecules with specific target properties remains a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry. While existing approaches show promise, most rely on simplified representations like SMILES strings or 2D graphs that lack essential three-dimensional geometric information. We present EvoDiffMol, a computational framework that integrates evolutionary algorithms with three-dimensional diffusion models for property-driven molecular generation. The method operates through adaptive evolutionary optimization, where population-based selection guides the generation process toward desired property landscapes. EvoDiffMol supports both unconstrained molecular design and scaffold-constrained generation that preserves fixed substructures while optimizing complementary regions. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving the highest drug-likeness score (0.94) among all compared state-of-the-art methods while maintaining excellent validity, uniqueness, and novelty. Beyond single property optimization, the framework demonstrates flexible multi-property optimization capabilities, simultaneously controlling multiple molecular descriptors including synthetic accessibility, lipophilicity, topological polar surface area, and clinically relevant ADMET properties such as cardiotoxicity (hERG) and intestinal permeability (Caco-2). This adaptability spans from simple descriptors to practical pharmaceutical endpoints without requiring complete model retraining. The framework achieves precise control over target property values, generating molecules with properties closely matching specified targets for both single and multiple descriptors. Scaffold-constrained experiments preserve fixed molecular cores while maintaining effective property optimization. The three-dimensional geometric awareness enables superior structure-property relationships compared to sequence-based approaches, establishing a new paradigm for geometry-aware molecular design with significant implications for materials science and drug discovery.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence,2026-01-14T13:36:39.070Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information for EvoDiffMol', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/695c2178900d745c4380780d/original/supplementary-information-for-evo-diff-mol.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69570311083c11e4a14027ed/original/evo-diff-mol-evolutionary-diffusion-framework-for-3d-molecular-design-with-optimized-properties.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-mdsdz,"PervoTransformer: Transformer-Based PCE Prediction
and Device Design with MACE MLIPs for CsSnX3 Perovskites","Perovskite solar cell performance depends on the joint configuration of materials, interfaces, and
layer-specific physical parameters, forming a structured design space that is naturally sequential but
rarely modeled as such. This work introduces PervoTransformer, a transformer-based framework that
represents complete device architectures as sequences and learns device-level behavior directly from
this representation. A RoBERTa model is finetuned on SCAPS-generated device sequences spanning
six perovskite families, including MAPbI3, FAPbI3, CsPbI3, and their Sn-based analogs. The model
predicts multiple performance metrics simultaneously, including power conversion efficiency (PCE),
short-circuit current density Jsc, open-circuit voltage Voc, and fill factor (FF), demonstrating that
transformer encoders can capture coupled, non-linear dependencies across the full device stack. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of transformer models to perovskite solar
cell device modeling using a sequence-based formulation. To explore device configurations beyond the
training distribution, a GPT-2 model is finetuned on the same device sequence formalism and used to
generate candidate architectures with novel combinations of compositional and physical parameters.
Generated sequences are screened for validity, uniqueness, and physical consistency using a retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) based constraint system. The validated devices are then passed back
through the finetuned RoBERTa model to predict performance metrics, enabling selection of high performing
candidates. Selected absorber configurations are further evaluated through device-level
simulations, forming an end-to-end loop for device prediction, generation, and screening. Additionally
machine-learned interatomic potentials based on the MACE framework are finetuned for CsSnX(X =
Cl,Br, I)3 using available DFT data, enabling efficient exploration of structural and energetic trends
in lead-free Sn perovskites and supporting absorber materials design. Together with the transformer based
predictive, generative, and screening workflow, this establishes a multi-scale strategy in which
sequence-aware transformers optimize device architectures while MLIPs guide atomic-scale materials
exploration for perovskite solar cells.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2026-01-14T12:58:15.701Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/695d748d900d745c43b05549/original/pervo-transformer-transformer-based-pce-prediction-and-device-design-with-mace-mli-ps-for-cs-sn-x3-perovskites.pdf

They connect bond angles to magnetic ordering for some transition metal compounds. Such domain knowledge is of high importance for building predictive machine learning models in scenarios with scarce data. Yet, there has been no statistical, large-scale evaluation of the heuristic. Here, we evaluate this heuristic on an experimental database of magnetic structures. We observe that the heuristic is largely satisfied, and we discuss the exceptions. We then demonstrate how integrating this heuristic into machine learning models for predicting magnetic ordering enhances prediction quality. Notably, these magnetism models are also capable of predicting if non-collinear magnetic ordering might occur. Furthermore, the heuristic provides a useful benchmark for evaluating theoretical methods that calculate magnetic properties.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bonding; Magnetism; Artificial Intelligence; Materials Chemistry,2026-01-13T10:43:37.342Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6960f173ff1c4bced43f740c/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6960effeff1c4bced43f2eb2/original/can-simple-exchange-heuristics-guide-us-in-predicting-magnetic-properties-of-solids.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-dtw9b,Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Chemistry: A Comprehensive Survey,"The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heralded a new era in artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding, generating, and reasoning with human language. Their potential to revolutionize scientific discovery, particularly in chemistry, is immense. However, standalone LLMs are inherently limited by their reliance on static pre-training data, leading to issues such as factual hallucination, outdated knowledge, and a lack of transparency in their reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to mitigate these limitations by grounding LLM responses in external, up-to-date, and verifiable knowledge sources. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the intersection of RAG and LLMs within the chemical sciences. We delve into the foundational concepts of LLMs and RAG, detail the unique architectures and methodologies required for handling diverse chemical data, and systematically review their applications across drug discovery, materials science, reaction prediction, and chemical literature mining. Furthermore, we critically examine the existing challenges, limitations, and ethical considerations inherent in deploying RAG-LLMs in chemistry. Finally, we discuss promising future directions, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation benchmarks and advanced multimodal RAG systems to unlock the full potential of these transformative technologies in accelerating chemical innovation.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2026-01-13T06:58:56.220Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6960605c5c91413e6ee2de6a/original/retrieval-augmented-large-language-models-for-chemistry-a-comprehensive-survey.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-l1d11,Automated QSAR — how good is it in practice?,"Over the past two decades, quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling has evolved substantially, driven by improved data accessibility, open-source descriptor generation, mature ma- chine learning libraries, and scalable cloud computing. Large-scale benchmarking studies using public datasets have demonstrated the feasibility of building predictive models across hundreds of endpoints. In parallel, automated machine learning (Auto-ML) approaches have emerged as a promising means to lower the barrier to QSAR model development, enabling competitive performance without extensive expert intervention. 
Here, we describe the design and implementation of an automated QSAR modeling system inte- grated into the CDD Vault platform, referred to as CDD Vault Inference Models. The system auto- matically trains, evaluates, and deploys regression models whenever new assay data become available, without requiring users to select endpoints, descriptors, or learning algorithms. Using public datasets from ChEMBL, we developed a fully automated workflow for model training and continuous evaluation. Models are released when a conservative performance threshold is achieved. The system is currently focused on building regression models. To give users a handle on model uncertainty, we also provide conformal prediction intervals. 
We discuss the implications of deploying fully automated QSAR models in a production environ- ment and outline future extensions. Together, this work demonstrates that automated, continuously updated QSAR modeling can provide practical and scalable decision support for drug discovery, par- ticularly in settings where dedicated modeling expertise is limited.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2026-01-16T14:04:30.605Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/696547505c91413e6e8e54f0/original/automated-qsar-how-good-is-it-in-practice.pdf

Herein, we introduce ScopeMap, an iterative, human-in-the-loop workflow designed to efficiently map functional limits rather than merely maximizing performance. Leveraging a modified Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) algorithm with a dynamic Geometric Repulsion Potential, ScopeMap transforms negative experimental feedback into geometric constraints, actively steering sampling toward unexplored frontiers. Validated against a comprehensive dataset of biomimetic aldol reactions and a cobalt-catalyzed coupling system, the workflow reconstructed >95% of the scope topology with significantly less experimental effort. Furthermore, we establish the U-Score and R-Score—metrics derived from Spatial Entropy and mean squared distance (MSD)—to provide a standardized framework for quantifying sampling uniformity and representativeness. This work offers a resource-efficient paradigm for defining reaction generality, shifting the focus from exhaustive data enumeration to information-dense boundary mapping.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2026-01-16T11:42:33.352Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Materials for  ScopeMap: An AI-Assisted, Human-in-the-Loop Workflow for Mapping Reaction Scope and Boundaries', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6966619dfc9dac0f37a94bd9/original/supplementary-materials-for-scope-map-an-ai-assisted-human-in-the-loop-workflow-for-mapping-reaction-scope-and-boundaries.docx'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69665bfefc9dac0f37a4af10/original/scope-map-an-ai-assisted-human-in-the-loop-workflow-for-mapping-reaction-scope-and-boundaries.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6khcw,Digitized dataset of aqueous dissociation constants,"The acid dissociation constant (pKa) quantifies the acidity of a compound, which is crucial for applications including drug design, environmental fate studies, and chemical synthesis. However, high-quality open-source digital pKa datasets are scarce, which limits the ability for researchers to search for properties of individual compounds, while also limiting the potential of data-driven predictive models. In this work, we release the IUPAC Digitized pKa Dataset, a digital version of a critically-assessed collection of data compiled up to 1970. The dataset includes metadata such as temperature, measurement method, assessed reliability of data, and chemical identifiers such as SMILES and InChI strings. The dataset spans 24,222 entries across 10,564 unique molecules, making it the largest FAIR open-source dataset publicly available for aqueous pKa data. Herein, we detail the data digitization and checking process, and assess the informational space spanned by the data. We compare the new digital dataset to other widely-used datasets. Several pKa predictors have been trained using these other datasets, but often have not been reliably tested due to overlap between the training and test data. We use the data to train a macroscopic pKa predictor and determine its accuracy using overlap-free test data.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-d4qw9,Auditing Domain Alignment in Latent Representations for Cross-Domain Materials Machine Learning,"Machine learning models are increasingly applied to heterogeneous materials datasets spanning different synthesis routes, measurement protocols, and structural classes. Although multi-task and representation-learning approaches are commonly used to improve predictive performance, the latent representations learned by such models are rarely examined directly, allowing domain misalignment to remain hidden until model transfer fails. Here, we present a practical, representation-level framework for auditing domain alignment in latent spaces learned by multi-task neural networks for materials property prediction. Using porous carbon materials and metal–organic frameworks as a representative cross-domain case study, we analyze a shared latent space trained across multiple target properties and regularization strategies. Global and local dimensionality-reduction visualizations are combined with quantitative measures of domain separability and latent–target correlation structure to assess alignment quality. We find that domain-alignment objectives induce measurable geometric reorganization and partial large-scale mixing in latent space, while domain identity remains locally recoverable and physically interpretable monotonic associations between latent dimensions and target properties are preserved. These diagnostics reveal structural differences in learned representations that are not apparent from conventional performance metrics alone and enable model comparison based on latent-space geometry rather than predictive accuracy. The proposed auditing framework is model-agnostic and can be readily integrated into existing materials machine learning workflows, providing a practical tool for improving robustness and interpretability in cross-domain materials modeling.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2026-01-16T02:53:13.876Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information for ""Auditing Domain Alignment in Latent Representations for Cross-Domain Materials Machine Learning""', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69657be8ff1c4bced4e15d5f/original/supplementary-information-for-auditing-domain-alignment-in-latent-representations-for-cross-domain-materials-machine-learning.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/696579675c91413e6e9bc931/original/auditing-domain-alignment-in-latent-representations-for-cross-domain-materials-machine-learning.pdf

Here, we demonstrate how contributions from system-specific electronic structure machine learning (ESML) models may be combined (“stitched”) to deliver density matrices of entire systems of interest, improving the initial guess for the self-consistent field cycle and delivering gains in computational efficiency. The “stitching” of density matrices is demonstrated for sequential calculations, such as geometry optimization and molecular dynamics, and we show that the synergistic use of ESML models and density matrix extrapolation algorithms can accelerate standard computational calculations. The algorithms are demonstrated for test cases relating to water clusters and a methane clathrate cage, with the benefits discussed.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-z8srk,Deep Learning for Assay Nuisance Compound Detection Using a Gated Co-Attention Graph Embedding Model (CAGE- Fusion),"In drug discovery, nuisance compounds are chemicals that interfere with biochemical or cell-based assays, often generating misleading signals unrelated to true activity. These molecules operate through diverse, context-dependent mechanisms, ranging from colloidal aggregation to covalent reactivity. They are often referred to as Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS), signal interferers, or frequent hitters, depending on their mode of action, and they lead to costly false positives and resource misallocation. They are difficult to distinguish from genuine pharmacological activity using rigid substructure filters. Although deep learning has emerged as a powerful alternative, most existing architectures process molecular graphs or SMILES sequences in isolation. We introduce CAGE-Fusion (Co-Attention Graph Embedding Fusion), a multimodal framework that employs a gated co-attention mechanism to enforce bidirectional information exchange between graph-based and sequence-based encoders. This architecture enables the iterative refinement of atom and token embeddings, yielding a chemically coherent representation that captures cross-modal dependencies missed by single-view baselines. CAGE-Fusion demonstrates superior predictive performance across several MoleculeNet benchmarks and achieves a macro-averaged ROC-AUC of 0.94 and MCC of 0.65 on a comprehensive nuisance compound classification task.

Cyclic alcohols constitute a major fraction of biomass-derived compounds, and their catalytic upgrading via zeolite-catalyzed alkylation provides an efficient route toward fuels and fine chemicals. In particular, benzene alkylation enables the synthesis of industrially relevant alkylated aromatics, while phenol alkylation is crucial for the valorization of lignin-derived feedstocks. Here, we employ machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) combined with well-tempered Metadynamics (WTMetaD) to investigate the alkylation of benzene and phenol using cyclohexene---the dehydrated form of cyclohexanol---as the alkylating agent within a zeolite framework. Free-energy surfaces (FES) obtained from enhanced sampling simulations are refined beyond standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA) density functional theory (DFT) using free-energy perturbation (FEP) to achieve MP2 and CCSD(T) accuracy. Our results reveal that it is essential to move beyond standard GGA-based DFT to accurately assess the stability of charged intermediates. The arenium ion (or Wheland intermediate), a key $\sigma$-complex in electrophilic aromatic substitution, appears relatively stable at the GGA level of theory.  However, higher-level CCSD(T) calculations show that it corresponds to only a weakly stabilized, shallow minimum, indicating a highly transient character. The presence of an activating group such as the hydroxyl substituent in phenol significantly stabilizes both the arenium intermediate and the corresponding transition state, thereby lowering the overall alkylation activation barrier.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis,2026-01-13T07:03:17.901Z,"[{'title': 'To Be or Not to Be: The Elusive Nature of Wheland-type Intermediates in Zeolite-Catalyzed Aromatic Alkylation Revealed by CCSD(T)-quality Metadynamics (Supplementary materials)', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/696178d8ff1c4bced45819a5/original/to-be-or-not-to-be-the-elusive-nature-of-wheland-type-intermediates-in-zeolite-catalyzed-aromatic-alkylation-revealed-by-ccsd-t-quality-metadynamics-supplementary-materials.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69616d42fc9dac0f37f7a119/original/to-be-or-not-to-be-the-elusive-nature-of-wheland-type-intermediates-in-zeolite-catalyzed-aromatic-alkylation-revealed-by-ccsd-t-quality-metadynamics.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-dsz7v,A Rigorous Statistical Benchmark of the Tsetlin Machine: A Novel Rule-Based Method Exceeding SOTA for QSAR Prioritisation,"Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) remains an effective tool for early-stage chemical modelling and virtual screening in drug design. The advancements in this field are led by two core paradigms, 1) descriptor engineering, where complex fixed-length vectors of compounds are generated and conventional ML methods are applied to those representations and 2) raw chemical inputs (e.g., SMILES, 2D-graph) are provided to complex deep learning neural network models which construct their own internal representations of molecules to quantify their biological activity. Conventional ML uses simple, computationally efficient algorithms and achieves state of the art accuracy on dataset sizes typical of practical QSAR applications. NN-based ML may not be as accurate for these dataset sizes but is inherently flexible and can learn iteratively. Here we present the Tsetlin Machine as a new potential QSAR method - which combines the accuracy and easy-use of existing rule-based QSAR ML methods (e.g., RF and XGBoost) with the continuous learning aspect and flexibility of NN algorithms. The Tsetlin Machine uses teams of finite-state automata which capture frequent patterns as propositional logic (clauses) in a reinforcement learning based game. We compare the TM's performance to existing rule-based QSAR methods using a benchmarking pipeline developed by the Polaris group. It uses repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD to measure the difference in mean performance distributions. Across all tested targets, compound groups and descriptor types, the TM consistently achieved high ROC AUC and PPV scores - making it well-suited for QSAR-based compound prioritization, especially in early stages of virtual screening pipelines. SOTA results were achieved with the TM for MOR (ROC-AUC = 0.87, PRC-AUC = 0.77) and CYPA4 (ROC-AUC = 0.92, PRC-AUC = 0.63), demonstrating comparable and in certain cases superior performance of TM over the established SOTA models. Additionally, this work contains practical guidelines for applying TMs to QSAR tasks including descriptor selection, model parameters and number of training epochs that were used to produce the reported SOTA results.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bgc3j-v2,In Silico Isomerization Produces Apt Negative Data for VHTS Validation,"Early on in the emergence of virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS), it was recognized that for validation to be robust and reliable, decoys should match actives as closely as possible in as many aspects as possible. This has given rise to several generations of validation sets that address previously reported shortcomings of earlier collections. This is an iterative and expensive method of curating validation sets that leaves ample scope for discrepancies between actives and decoys to creep in. It has previously been conjectured that in silico isomerization offers an attractive alternative to generating decoys for drug-like compounds that naturally mitigates many of these discrepancies. Here, we explore this proposition and prove the conjecture. We show that isomerization can produce molecules that have hydrogen bond acceptor, donor, rotatable bonds counts, charge and surface area distributions that match more closely experimental actives than experimental decoys. While these are properties that receive a lot of attention in drug design, we also show that isomerization can effectively produce decoys that are positioned more closely to actives in property hyperspace than current experimental decoys which tend to be highly dissimilar from the actives. The latter is a significant shortcoming that has thus far remained unreported and unaddressed. Herein, we build upon the methods, tools, and work of others to facilitate the generation of new and better validation sets more cheaply and efficiently in the hope of moving the field of VHTS forward toward maturity.

The MUltiscale SImulation frameworK (MUSIK) integrates conformer analysis, density functional theory and high-level coupled-cluster energetics, and graph-based lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) to generate chemically accurate, spatially and temporally resolved kinetic models for polymer transformations without parameter fitting. The present work introduces MUSIK as a reproducible workflow and provides a step-by-step tutorial that shows how to construct, run, and analyze a lattice kMC model for base-assisted dehydrochlorination of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), supported by post-processing scripts that automate kMC trajectory analysis and polymer-structure reconstruction. Tutorial results demonstrate how MUSIK links atomic energetics and local structure to macroscopic kinetics and structural evolution and reproduces key experimental observations for PVC dehydrochlorination. MUSIK is generalizable to arbitrary polymer chemistries and can provide practical recommendations for polymer recycling, upcycling, and materials design to address plastic-waste challenge.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-h0kn1,"AIQM-PBSA: Integrating Machine Learning Interatomic
Potentials with MMPBSA for Accurate Protein–Ligand Binding Free Energy Calculations","End-point binding free energy (BFE) methods, such as molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA), are widely used to estimate protein–ligand binding affinity due to their favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Their reliability, however, is often limited by approximations in intramolecular interactions and solvation effects. Given the critical role of force field quality in determining accuracy, we developed a hybrid framework named AIQM-PBSA, which integrates the ONIOM scheme with the PBSA model. Within this framework, the AIQM3 machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) —an advanced Δ-learning quantum mechanical (QM) model—is employed to refine the molecular mechanics (MM) energy term, while polar and non polar solvation contributions are evaluated under the PBSA formalism. Extensive validation across diverse protein–ligand systems demonstrates that AIQM-PBSA significantly improves the correlation with experimental binding affinities compared to MMPBSA based on classical force fields and other MLIPs, with a representative benchmark showing up to 31% higher Pearson correlation relative to the MMPBSA baseline and 16% higher than ANI-2x. Furthermore, incorporating entropic contributions can further provide modest, target-dependent improvements. In summary, AIQM-PBSA offers a robust and transferable framework that combines QM level accuracy with MM level efficiency, substantially enhancing the reliability of endpoint free energy calculations for biomolecular recognition.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry,2026-01-13T07:40:27.912Z,"[{'title': 'ANI-2x_JACS_Performance', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6961ba63ff1c4bced45f08dc/original/ani-2x-jacs-performance.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6961b13bff1c4bced45e2c51/original/aiqm-pbsa-integrating-machine-learning-interatomic-potentials-with-mmpbsa-for-accurate-protein-ligand-binding-free-energy-calculations.pdf

Three models—undoped C60 , single BN-pair doped (C58 B1 N1 ), and multi-pair doped (C50 B5 N5 )—were systematically analyzed to evaluate structural stability, electronic modulation, and adsorption characteristics. Results reveal that single-pair BN doping drastically enhances VOC
adsorption, particularly for polar molecules such as formaldehyde (HCHO), exhibiting an adsorption energy of 0.47 eV, a band gap reduction from 1.08 eV to 0.20 eV, and a conductivity increase up to 1016 (σ /τ) Ω−1 cm−1 s−1 at 300 K. Charge density difference and Bader charge analyses confirm strong charge transfer and orbital hybridization between HCHO and the doped surface. These
findings demonstrate that controlled BN substitution significantly improves surface reactivity and sensitivity, establishing BN-doped fullerene monolayers as superior and tunable platforms for VOC detection and environmental monitoring applications.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry,2026-01-16T13:24:04.492Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/696723645c91413e6ee37025/original/bn-engineered-quasi-2d-fullerene-monolayers-as-high-performance-platforms-for-volatile-organic-compound-capture-and-detection.pdf

As correlated motion of peptide regulates intramolecular signal transmission, IL–dipeptide interactions critically influence protein structure and functional regulation, emphazising the importance of their molecular-level investigation. In this study, we considered a set of dipeptides (AA) classified as neutral and ionic (mono and di) AA to explore their interaction phenomena with IL: [EMIM][TFSI]. In doing so, interactions between IL and individual amino acids (A) were also examined to establish residue-level insights. Our results reveal that each AA exhibits a distinct interaction profile with the IL, where the dominant interaction domain involves either the EMIM/TFSI or co operative contribution from both, depending on the chemical nature of the constituent A. Notably, electrostatic nature dominates in IL-ionic AA complex whereas dispersion energy emerges as the primary stabilizing factor in IL-AA complexes involving aromatic A. Overall, molecular basis of AA–IL interaction profiles establishes a robust understanding of peptide-mediated solvent dynamics and activity regulation of protein in IL.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational,2026-01-16T10:45:55.177Z,"[{'title': 'Theoretical Insights into Energetics and Structural Modulation of Dipeptides through Ionic Liquid [EMIM][TFSI] Interactions', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69661a1cfc9dac0f3799f267/original/theoretical-insights-into-energetics-and-structural-modulation-of-dipeptides-through-ionic-liquid-emim-tfsi-interactions.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6966154ffc9dac0f3798576e/original/theoretical-insights-into-energetics-and-structural-modulation-of-dipeptides-through-ionic-liquid-emim-tfsi-interactions.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-ftf87,The nodal structure of π-orbitals is mapped in the interaction energy of π-stacked acene dimers,"We explain that the repulsive contributions to intermolecular interactions have a decisive influence on the energetic preference on prototypical π-stacked structures of acene dimers. Remarkably, this results from the wave nature of the respective π- orbitals which is rationalized by a partitioning of the exchange repulsion energy, Exr, into orbital-orbital contributions. The latter was recently proposed as the Molecular Orbital-Pair Contributions to the Exchange repulsion (MOPCE) approach. It is used here to distinguish between π-π-, π-σ-, and σ-σ-contributions to Exr. For parallel displaced acene dimers with constant interplanar distance the π-π-contributions are shown to cause oscillations of the interaction energy as a function of the displacement coordinates. The oscillations can be traced back to the squared overlap of the π-orbitals, that can be rationalized with a simple particle-in-a-box model. This reproduces and rationalizes the interaction energies of benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene, and pentacene dimers obtained with Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory. Our results shed light into the nature of the exchange repulsion energy as a quantum mechanical property. This means, we present a generally applicable and intuitive model for the interaction of stacked π-systems that is fully consistent with state of the art quantum chemical results and reminiscent to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Quantum Mechanics; Materials Chemistry,2026-01-16T07:26:30.029Z,"[{'title': 'additional figures and tables referred to in the manuscript', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69654a51ff1c4bced4d3de8e/original/additional-figures-and-tables-referred-to-in-the-manuscript.pdf'}, {'title': 'original numerical data for figures', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69654ab55c91413e6e8edd9e/original/original-numerical-data-for-figures.zip'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/696547ab5c91413e6e8e602d/original/the-nodal-structure-of-orbitals-is-mapped-in-the-interaction-energy-of-stacked-acene-dimers.pdf

This review traces the experimental evolution of three key protein nanopores—α-hemolysin, MspA, and CsgG—highlighting how iterative engineering overcame challenges such as translocation control and homopolymer resolution. Concurrently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have elucidated DNA–pore interactions, ion current modulation, free-energy landscapes, and so forth, providing mechanistic insights and guiding rational design. However, MD studies consistently lag behind experimental and industrial advances, resulting in a reactive “simulate-after-validate” paradigm. We identify critical gaps in simulating motor–pore complexes, experimental timescales, and emerging designs like dual-constriction pores. To bridge these, we propose leveraging deep learning-based structure prediction, de novo protein design, and advanced multiscale simulations to foster proactive, integrated development of next-generation nanopore technologies.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Biophysical Chemistry,2026-01-16T05:11:43.483Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6964ac2a5c91413e6e7952a5/original/nanopore-sequencing-with-proteins-synchronization-and-dischronization-of-molecular-dynamics-simulations-with-laboratory-and-industrial-developments.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-s2jgl-v3,Benchmarking of Vibrational Exciton Models Against Quantum-Chemical Localized-Mode Calculations,"Vibrational exciton models are widely used for the simulation of biomolecular vibrational spectra, in particular of two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectra. The parameters entering such models, specifically harmonic local-mode frequencies and harmonic coupling constants, are provided by vibrational maps, which have been parametrized against computational data for small molecules as well as  experimental data. Here, we put forward a novel approach for assessing the quality of these harmonic vibrational maps against quantum-chemical reference data. For a test set consisting of molecular dynamics snapshots of polypeptides and small proteins, covering different secondary structure motifs, we performed full quantum-chemical calculations of harmonic vibrational frequencies and normal modes, and applied a localization of normal modes to obtain localized-mode frequencies and coupling constants. These can be directly compared to those predicted by vibrational maps. We find that while there is a good correlation for the coupling constants and for local-mode frequencies of isolated polypeptides, there is hardly any correlation for the local-mode frequencies of solvated polypeptides. This striking finding calls into question the accuracy of the electrostatic maps that are used to model the effect of the solvent molecules on local-mode frequencies.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.),2026-01-15T02:40:06.393Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69637bc7ff1c4bced49715bf/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69637bc7ff1c4bced49715b3/original/benchmarking-of-vibrational-exciton-models-against-quantum-chemical-localized-mode-calculations.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-r4vfs-v2,Improved Molecular Conductance Predictions using Wavefunction-in-DFT Quantum Embedding,"A novel electronic structure methodology to describe electron transport in Single-Molecule junctions (SMJs) within non-equilibrium Green’s function theory (NEGF), is presented. The approach is based on a formally exact, projection-based quantum embedding (PbE) technique that combines correlated many-electron wavefunction models for the molecular region with a Density Functional Theory (DFT) description of the metallic electrodes. This is achieved by constructing a specialized Hamiltonian for the molecular domain, leveraging Dyson orbitals corresponding to the ionized and electron-attached states of the embedded molecule. The effectiveness of this wavefunction-in-DFT (WFT-in-DFT) embedding scheme is demonstrated through transport calculations for SMJs containing benzene-1,4-diamine (BDA) and its substituted derivatives, employing Hartree–Fock, SOS-ADC(2), and CCSD methods for the molecular subsystem. The results show a marked improvement in the predicted zero-bias conductance compared to conventional DFT-based transport modeling employing the PBE functional. The proposed methodology provides a systematic way to select the most suitable electronic structure methods for the different parts of the system, maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational cost,  while ensuring a proper description of electronic correlation within the molecule, which may notably impact electron transport in certain systems.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.),2026-01-13T13:02:16.626Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Material', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69612c99fc9dac0f37ebf8ea/original/supplementary-material.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69612c99fc9dac0f37ebf8df/original/improved-molecular-conductance-predictions-using-wavefunction-in-dft-quantum-embedding.pdf

Here, we study a series of symmetric and asymmetric InveST-bridged diradicals based on the small- est InveST motif, 1,3-diazete, functionalized with allyl and phenalenyl radical units. Within the Pariser–Parr–Pople (PPP) framework, these systems possess disjoint di- radical ground states with degenerate singlet and triplet levels, while population of the bridge LUMO triggers finite exchange interactions that stabilize the triplet excited state. Torsional flexibility at the bridge–radical junctions plays a key role in trigger- ing spin–orbit coupling, thereby promoting intersystem crossing between the lowest excited singlet and triplet states. Through evaluation of intersystem crossing and re- verse intersystem crossing rates using a vibronic model, we find that all three diradicals support net population transfer from the singlet to the triplet manifold under ambient conditions.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Quantum Computing,2026-01-12T07:57:22.651Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/695ecfcf083c11e4a160bd27/original/spin-coupling-in-symmetric-and-asymmetric-allyl-and-phenalenyl-diradicals-bridged-by-an-inverted-singlet-triplet-system.pdf
