However, despite this progress, the adoption of data-driven approaches in atomic layer deposition (ALD) remains limited to a few pioneering studies. In this perspective, we take a first step toward closing this gap and bringing machine learning closer to ALD by introducing the key concepts of relevant algorithms and workflows, surveying the current literature, and outlining challenges and future directions for applying machine learning in ALD. We provide ideas on how the field can proceed to harvest the full potential of machine learning based approaches for ALD which promises to enable precursor and material design as well as strongly improved computational and experimental approaches for atomic layer processing.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Thin Films; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Most of the current machine learning interatomic potentials do not distinguish between different spin states, making them unsuitable for open-shell reactive chemistry. Here we present AIMNet2-NSE (Neural Spin-charge Equilibration), a neural network potential that incorporates spin-charge equilibration for accurate treatment of molecules and reactions with arbitrary charge and spin multiplicities. Built upon the AIMNet2 framework, AIMNet2-NSE is trained on an extensive dataset comprising 20 million closed-shell neutral and charged molecules, 13 million open-shell radical configurations, and 200,000 radical reaction profiles. With explicit handling of spin charges, AIMNet2-NSE enables prediction of spin-resolved properties with near-DFT accuracy while maintaining a favorable linear scaling compared to the polynomial scaling of electronic structure methods. The predictive capabilities and generalizability of our model are confirmed by evaluations on large-scale radical test sets, the industrially relevant BASChem19 benchmark, and radical polymerization reactions. Overall, AIMNet2-NSE represents a significant advancement in machine learned interatomic potentials, allowing efficient exploration of complex open-shell systems, and significantly advancing our ability to model radical reaction pathways and reactive intermediates in chemical processes where traditional quantum mechanical methods are computationally prohibitive. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information for AIMNet2-NSE: A Transferable Reactive Neural Network Potential for Open-Shell Chemistry", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/692d304c65a54c2d4a7ab3d7/original/supplementary-information-for-aim-net2-nse-a-transferable-reactive-neural-network-potential-for-open-shell-chemistry.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Despite its therapeutic promise, TIMP2 has long been considered 'undruggable' due to its cryptic surface topology and lack of canonical active sites. We present a comprehensive computational pipeline integrating CNS-filtered virtual screening, orthogonal ADMET/toxicity validation, and allosteric site targeting to identify small-molecule modulators of TIMP2. Screening ~600,000 CNS-filtered compounds from ZINC20 against a cryptic N-terminal allosteric site (Val6, Leu100, Phe103) identified 178 compounds with favorable drug-like properties. Orthogonal validation using ProTox-III refined this to 154 highest-confidence candidates (Tier 1A) validated across multiple computational toxicology platforms. Site selectivity analysis revealed 99.5% preference for the primary allosteric pocket, establishing it as the dominant binding site for therapeutic intervention. Chemical diversity analysis identified 15 distinct scaffold families spanning both halogenated (26.6%) and non-halogenated (73.4%) chemotypes, demonstrating multiple viable strategies for achieving CNS penetration with clean safety profiles. Our findings challenge the notion of TIMP2 as an undruggable protein and provide 154 experimentally-ready chemical starting points for therapeutic development targeting neuroplasticity and cognitive enhancement.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplemental Materials", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/692cca3f65a54c2d4a72273c/original/supplemental-materials.zip"}]</p></details> |

In this work, we integrate optimization, machine learning, and data science techniques to accelerate the systematic design and parameterization of transferable FF models. As a demonstration, we create transferable FF models for one- and two-carbon hydrofluorocarbons to accurately model diverse thermophysical properties including saturated liquid and vapor densities, vapor pressure, and enthalpy of vaporization. Estimability analysis and eigen-decomposition of the Fisher information matrix inform the number an identity of atom types in the final FF model. This model obtains an average mean absolute percent deviation (MAPD) between 2.92% (liquid density) and 31.5% (vapor density) on molecules not considered in the training set. This model (MAPD = 18.37%) also achieves a lower overall MAPD than an optimized version of the generalized AMBER FF (MAPD = 19.95%). Gaussian process surrogate models reduce the evaluation time associated with model selection and optimization from an order of months to minutes. This work suggests that the use of surrogate models combined with data science and optimization methods can greatly accelerate the development of accurate transferable force fields.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Development of Accurate Transferable Hydrofluorocarbon Refrigerant Force Fields Using a Machine Learning and Optimization Approach", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6933011765a54c2d4a4ca7b3/original/supporting-information-development-of-accurate-transferable-hydrofluorocarbon-refrigerant-force-fields-using-a-machine-learning-and-optimization-approach.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Extracting graph representations of 344,756 relaxed geometries and their associated adsorption energies from the OC20 database, we used them to train a 24,777 node SIDT that achieves 0.36 eV MDAE, 0.54 eV MAE, and 0.82 eV RMSE. We then developed and implemented novel techniques to use SIDTs as generative models enabling efficient catalyst optimization for arbitrary objective functions and constraints as a function of the adsorption energies and prediction uncertainties of multiple adsorbates and the catalyst structure itself. In particular, our SIDT provides substructure representations of the subdistributions of adsorption energy, rather than mere samples from the subdistributions as is commonly done in traditional generative modeling. We show how this can be exploited for efficient and interpretable catalyst active site design in two examples. For the ammonia decomposition reaction sequence we show we are able to use our generative techniques to minimize the overall barrier height of the sequence generating catalysts substructures predicted to decrease the overall barrier from 2.7 eV on Pt(111) to 0.4 eV.  We also discuss how we can exploit the accurate SIDT uncertainties and the interpretability of the SIDT to identify regions of chemical space that are in need of improved coverage and might be improved using active learning schemes.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "SIDT Model for Adsorption Energy Prediction", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/692f29f8ef936fb4a2ae600b/original/sidt-model-for-adsorption-energy-prediction.json"}]</p></details> |

Accurate quantum chemistry calculations are very expensive and evaluation of the entire ensemble found during a conformational search is often unachievable. This is especially true for complex transition state structures such as those in asymmetric catalysis. We develop a Bayesian optimization method to locate the minimum energy conformer of a chemical system, which greatly reduces the numbers of structures that must be optimized with expensive methods, such as DFT. Out of the tens or hundreds of conformers found (up to 625) for each chemical system, we find that our approach required optimization of on average approximately 15% of each system's total search space. Our method finds the lowest energy conformers of flexible transition states in asymmetric catalysis just as rapidly as for single molecules, indicating good general performance even in highly complex cases that are important to real-world chemistry.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Alleviating the Conformational Bottleneck in Mechanistic Modeling with Bayesian Optimization", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69316874a10c9f5ca121118a/original/supporting-information-alleviating-the-conformational-bottleneck-in-mechanistic-modeling-with-bayesian-optimization.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The workflow—DFT-trained cluster expansions (CE) → Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC) → microkinetics—predicts site-resolved ΔE(*N) and enables composition-wide maps of site-specific turnover frequency (TOF) and surface-averaged activity (⟨TOF⟩). MMC captures temperature-driven Cu enrichment at the outermost layer, shifting ΔE(*N) toward weaker binding relative to statistically random surfaces and suppresses ⟨TOF⟩. Lowering Cu systematically increases activity; by contrast, Cu-free Co–Fe–Mo–Ni medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) cluster near the volcano maximum and deliver high, composition-robust rates. Site-level analysis shows that the most active B5 ensembles are Cu-lean and typically multimetallic, consistent with surface-averaged trends. DFT validation on 40 CE-screened high-activity B5 sites confirms predictive fidelity. The framework yields practical, testable design rules—minimize Cu participation at B5 and preserve configurational disorder (e.g., thermal-shock)—and is readily extensible to other alloy families and to both thermochemical and electrochemical reactions. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Fuels - Energy Science | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Objective biomarkers are critically needed, but their discovery is hampered by limited understanding of the disease etiology. Robust unbiased, hypothesis-free, and untargeted discovery methods combined with machine learning could prove valuable in providing diagnostic utility. In this study, a novel surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-cucurbit[5]uril (CB[5]) approach for biomarker discovery was applied for the first time in a clinical setting in combination with an explainable AI driven approach to distinguish BD from MDD. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples were collected from 130 patients with BD and MDD and analysed using SERS and AuNP-CB[5] aggregates. An XGBoost machine learning model was trained to differentiate the groups, with the Context Representative Interpretable Model Explanations (CRIME) method used to identify the most predictive spectral features. These features were subsequently correlated with metabolites measured using targeted mass spectrometry to identify underlying biomarkers. The model distinguished BD from MDD with an AUC of 0.66 (P = 0.003). The predictions were driven by two primary spectral peak regions identified through correlation analysis. The most important peak (1450 cm-¹) corresponded to hypoxanthine, which was significantly upregulated in the BD group. The link between hypoxanthine and the SERS signal was supported by experimental confirmation of correlated spectral peaks, validating the method’s specificity. This study validates a comprehensive DBS-SERS-AuNP-CB[5] clinical discovery pipeline, establishing a powerful, unbiased framework that opens new avenues for developing point-of-care diagnostics for complex neuropsychiatric disorders and other conditions.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Spectroscopy (Anal.

However, the adoption of these advanced techniques has not been uniform across all subfields of materials science; thermoelectrics, for instance, has experienced a relatively slower penetration. This lag can be attributed to several inherent challenges, including the physical complexity of thermoelectric phenomena, the scarcity and reliability issues of available data, and limitations concerning the applicability of general models. To address these challenges, in this work, we have developed a machine learning model, based on neural networks, specifically for the accurate prediction of the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) in skutterudites. This model demonstrates high accuracy, with prediction errors approaching the range of experimental uncertainties reported for zT measurements. Furthermore, it offers the crucial capability of extracting design rules grounded in the underlying physics and chemistry of these materials, providing valuable insights for optimization. Most importantly, our model is applicable for the high-throughput screening of extensive chemical spaces, facilitating the efficient discovery of novel and high-performance thermoelectric materials.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Thermal Conductors and Insulators; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Deep Learning Framework for Accurate Prediction and High- Throughput Search of the Thermoelectric Figure of Merit in Skutterudites", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/692f9e87ef936fb4a2c1722b/original/deep-learning-framework-for-accurate-prediction-and-high-throughput-search-of-the-thermoelectric-figure-of-merit-in-skutterudites.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Current machine learning methods map structures to properties with remarkable accuracy, yet they do not leverage available property information when predicting unknowns, creating unutilized partial information. Here, a flexible transformer architecture is developed that addresses this gap by predicting molecular properties from any combination of available properties and structural information. The model employs custom embedding layers differentiating present from missing values, self-attention mechanisms learning property-property relationships, and property-specific decoders handling variable output sets. Testing on 16M organic molecules with 23 properties through 710 independently trained models subject to fixed missingness reveals R\textsuperscript{2} values of 0.75-0.85 for property-to-property predictions without structural data, confirming the imputation utility of extant property data. Models combining structure and property information consistently outperform either alone. In harder random missingness scenarios, self-supervised protocols accurately complete sparse datasets with average R\textsuperscript{2} values of 0.79 and 0.85 in two case studies. This work establishes a new paradigm enabling models to utilize all available molecular information flexibly.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Background: Pharmaceutical batch production faces significant scheduling challenges due to operational uncertainties including equipment failures, yield variability, and demand fluctuations. While scheduling heuristics are widely used in practice, their comparative performance under varying uncertainty conditions remains insufficiently characterized, particularly for single-reactor configurations common in specialty pharmaceutical manufacturing.
Methods: A discrete-event simulation model was developed for a single 10,000L bioreactor producing three antibiotic products with fermentation times of 48, 72, and 120 hours. Three scheduling heuristics (FIFO, SPT, LPT) were evaluated across three uncertainty levels (Low, Medium, High) using 150 randomly generated demand scenarios, yielding 450 total observations. Statistical analyses included two-way factorial ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis tests, multiple linear regression, and ANCOVA. Machine learning classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression) were trained to predict schedule robustness.
Results: Both heuristic type (F = 225.71, p < .001, η² = 0.285) and uncertainty level (F = 346.69, p < .001, η² = 0.437) significantly affected makespan, with no interaction effect (p = .981). SPT achieved mean makespan of 1,992 hours compared to 2,387 hours for FIFO (16.5% improvement). However, SPT and LPT were not significantly different from each other (p = 1.000 after Bonferroni correction). Uncertainty increased makespan by 28.2% from low to high conditions. Machine learning models achieved 90-97% classification accuracy, with Polynomial SVM performing best (96.7% accuracy, AUC = 0.972). Feature importance analysis consistently identified heuristic choice and uncertainty level as the dominant predictors, together explaining approximately 63% of classification accuracy.
Conclusions: Campaign-based scheduling strategies (SPT, LPT) significantly outperform round-robin approaches (FIFO) across all uncertainty conditions, with benefits remaining consistent regardless of uncertainty level. The equivalence of SPT and LPT suggests that either campaign strategy is effective, providing operational flexibility. Machine learning models can reliably predict schedule robustness, enabling proactive risk management in pharmaceutical manufacturing.

and system composition, without empirical parameterization. This review elucidates how this endeavor is built upon an interdependent hierarchy of physical theories, each contributing essential concepts and introducing inherent approximations. We trace the foundational role of Classical Mechanics via the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which separates nuclear and electronic motion, and the establishment of the molecular
Hamiltonian through the synergy of Quantum Mechanics and Classical Electromagnetism.1,2 We detail how
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics provide the critical link between microscopic quantum states and
macroscopic observables via the partition function.3 The review further examines the mandatory incorporation
of Relativity for heavy elements, governed by the Dirac equation, and the formal power of Quantum Field
Theory, which provides the second quantization formalism underpinning high-accuracy methods like Coupled
Cluster theory.4,5 Finally, we explore the emerging frontier of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in chemistry,
where the electromagnetic field itself is quantized.6 The discussion is framed by the central trade-off between
the rigorous inclusion of physical effects—from electron correlation to relativistic and QED corrections—and
the associated computational cost. This synthesis demonstrates that the ongoing evolution of ab initio methods is a systematic effort to replace convenience-driven classical approximations with rigorous, unified physical theories, thereby extending the domain of the first-principles prediction.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

While 2D elasticity theories such as Canham-Helfrich-Evans adequately capture the dominant energetics of membrane deformation, a full characterization of the 3D elastic response is necessary to account for the many modes of deformation and the role that lipid structure plays in determining the elastic energy. We use the stress-stress fluctuation (SSF) method to obtain local elasticity profiles of a simple water-dodecane interface and a lipid membrane from coarse-grained MARTINI molecular dynamics simulations. We validate the results from the SSF method through the explicit deformation method, which measures the change in the local stress tensor relative to a specific strain. Furthermore, we show that some expected symmetries of the elasticity tensor are locally broken due to the lateral fluidity of the interfacial systems and the physical constraint of mechanical equilibrium. Profiles of the lateral and transverse shear moduli show that the membrane is locally fluid, while the transverse shear modulus is locally non-zero but its integral vanishes. We define the area, Young's, and bulk moduli as well as the Poisson ratio for a lipid membrane through the compliance tensor, and use the area modulus to estimate the position of the neutral surface and macroscopic bending modulus. Our elasticity calculations provide critical insights into the local mechanical properties of lipid bilayers and unravel the role of lateral fluidity in the membrane's elastic response. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Materials Science; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Material", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6933230b65a54c2d4a506963/original/supplementary-material.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the stress-stress fluctuation (SSF) method to estimate the elastic properties of simple van der Waals and molecular materials. Starting with argon in the solid, liquid, and gas phases, we show that the SSF method gives elastic coefficients and moduli in excellent agreement with values obtained with the explicit deformation and volume fluctuation methods. Comparison of the elastic coefficients and bulk modulus for solid argon with previous computational studies and experimental data provide further validation of our numerical implementation. Beyond argon, we show that the elastic properties of molecular fluids simulated with the CG MARTINI force-field, which include multi-body interactions such as angle potentials, are also accurately captured by the SSF method. Moreover, the impulsive correction for truncated potentials is essential to obtain accurate values for these fluids and vanishing shear moduli. Our results highlight the broad applicability of the SSF method, which does not require any material deformation, across a broad range of systems and lays the foundation for its use to characterize the elastic properties of complex molecular systems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Materials Science; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Material", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6933203d65a54c2d4a4fe46b/original/supporting-material.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The associated maximum hardness principle (MHP), which postulates that, a favorable direction of reaction is towards the state of maximum hardness, has been widely applied as a guiding rule to govern the direction of chemical reactions. However, several studies have questioned its validity. In this work, we investigated the quantitative applicability of the MHP using two reaction datasets, viz, a dipolar cycloaddition dataset of 5269 reaction profiles and the more comprehensive BH9 dataset of 449 reactions. We adopted different approximations to compute the hardness, including Kohn-Sham orbital based frontier molecular orbital (FMO) and the finite difference approximation (FDA). The effect of using different definitions to compute the average hardness of bimolecular reactions is analysed on the valdity of MHP. Our analysis revealed dependence of hardness values on level of theory, definitions and approximations used which should be kept in mind before criticizing the MHP. Among 5269 cycloaddition reactions, approximately 80% of the reactions are found to obey the MHP. For BH9 dataset, MHP is found to better supported for unimolecular reactions, while remaining strongly dependent on the definition used to compute the average hardness for bimolecular reactions. Reactions in which the individual hardness of the reactants differs significantly are more likely to disobey MHP. Nonetheless, since these electronic structure principles are qualitative in nature, their validity cannot be expected to be
universal.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Revisiting the Maximum Hardness Principle: A Quantitative Analysis on Reaction Datasets", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6931adc9ef936fb4a21a928e/original/supporting-information-revisiting-the-maximum-hardness-principle-a-quantitative-analysis-on-reaction-datasets.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Building on a gradient-enhanced Kriging surrogate model and restricted-variance optimization, we introduce three key modifications: (i) a cost-effective subspace expansion using r-GDIIS or BFGS displacement predictions, (ii) a systematic undershoot mitigation strategy in flat energy regions, and (iii) rigorous coordinate and gradient transformations consistent with the exponential parametrization of orbital rotations. Benchmarking across an extensive set of molecular systems – including organic molecules, radicals, and transition-metal complexes – demonstrates that the new S-GEK/RVO variants consistently outperform the default (in OpenMolcas) r-GDIIS method in iteration count, convergence reliability, and wall time. These improvements make S-GEK/RVO a competitive alternative for SCF optimization and suggest broader applicability to other orbital optimization and localization problems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69318431a10c9f5ca12442d9/original/supporting-information.pdf"}, {"title": "Data", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69318431a10c9f5ca12442de/original/data.zip"}]</p></details> |

However, direct comparison of the accuracies of these methods is oftentimes challenging due to differences in studied systems, simulation parameters and system setup across studies. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel and well-defined model system for benchmarking water sampling methods: a closed, custom-defined C90 fullerene. Our C90 fullerene inherently adopts a distorted oblate-spheroidal geometry rather than being spherical; essentially, C90 is large enough to be almost a miniature, capped nanotube, unlike its C60 ``buckyball'' sibling. Unlike conventional fullerenes with nonpolar, hydrophobic cavities, our custom-defined fullerene incorporates some level of polarity in the form of modest partial charges, creating a quadrupolar cavity that energetically favors water binding. In our quadrupolar fullerene, positive and negative partial charges are distributed around the polar and the equatorial regions, respectively, on its approximate oblate spheroidal geometry. Due to a significant free energy barrier imposed by the fullerene wall, water exchange between the cavity and bulk solvent is essentially impossible on MD timescales.  To allow solvent water to equilibrate in the cavity, we introduce a solvent inlet, by performing Hamiltonian replica exchange (i.e., HREX) simulations, which reveal that the quadrupolar fullerene cavity can accommodate a maximum of two waters. From these HREX simulations, we also identify the water binding sites inside the cavity and their occupancies, which show that fullerene conformations with 2 or 1 waters inside the cavity are dominant, with nearly equal free energies. We further validate a non-equilibrium switching (NES) protocol for computing water displacement free energies, by removing a water from the conformations with 2 waters inside the cavity and comparing with the relevant free energies from the HREX simulations. Our NES free energies agree within statistical error with those obtained from HREX.  Our findings establish the quadrupolar fullerene as a well-defined reproducible test system for rigorously benchmarking current as well as future enhanced sampling techniques targeting slow water sampling in confined environments. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

The approximate nature of DFTB makes its reliability highly dependent on parameter quality though. While recent advancements have significantly improved the parametrization of the so-called repulsive potential, the parametrization of the electronic part of the DFTB interaction remains relatively simplistic and underdeveloped. We present our in-house DFTB Slater-Koster Optimizer (DSKO), a novel framework that aims at producing accurate and transferable electronic parameter sets under rigorous physical constraints. Incorporating robust optimization algorithms and physics-informed loss functions, DSKO generates DFTB electronic parameters that yield electronic properties, such as density of states and band structures, closely matching DFT reference data. The versatility of DSKO facilitates the wide application of DFTB to materials science challenges, paving the way for routine high-fidelity semiempirical simulations.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

It also reproduces the underlying free energy landscapes in quantitative agreement with those generated by much longer OPES simulations that employ sophisticated machine-learned collective variables. Furthermore, the free energy landscapes obtained from the OPES<\sub>COM<\sub> algorithm can identify metastable intermediate states, which can only be distinguished by water coordination descriptors, which are not included in the original set of collective variables used for bias deposition.
