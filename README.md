Despite advances in ML tools for both strategies, screening remains bounded by time and computational cost, while generative models frequently produce invalid and synthetically inaccessible molecules. Screening time can be improved with pharmacophore search, which quickly identifies ligands in a database that match a pharmacophore query. In this work, we introduce PharmacoForge, a diffusion model for generating 3D pharmacophores conditioned on a protein pocket. Generated pharmacophore queries identify ligands that are guaranteed to be valid, commercially available molecules. We evaluate PharmacoForge against automated pharmacophore generation methods using the LIT-PCBA benchmark and ligand generative models through a docking- based evaluation framework. We further assess pharmacophore quality through a retrospective screening of the DUD-E dataset. PharmacoForge surpasses other pharmacophore generation methods in the LIT-PCBA benchmark, and resulting ligands from pharmacophore queries performed similarly to de novo generated ligands when docking to DUD-E targets and had lower strain energies compared to de novo generated ligands.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

The successful synthesis of Mo$_5$N$_6$ and the identification of its atomic arrangements (labeled as $\alpha$ and $\gamma$), along with the resolved structure of TiC$_2$, raise an important question: What are the possible atomic structures of M$_n$X$_{n+1}$ layers across different transition metals $M$ and values of $n$? In this work, we identify a new structural prototype, denoted as $\beta$, through a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and evolutionary optimization. By systematically exploring the stable polymorphs of 32 anti-MXenes structures with the formula M$_n$X$_{n+1}$ (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Nb, Mo, Ta, and W, $n = 2, 3, 4, 5$), we find that the $\beta$ structure is more favorable in thinner compositions ($n = 2$) and tends to appear at outermost layers of thicker structures ($n = 5$), leading to hybrid structures that are mixtures of $\alpha$/$\gamma$ and $\beta$ configuration. We identify a range of non-trivial electronic states in these materials: semimetals, flat bands, a semiconductor and materials with high electronc density at the Fermi level. Further analysis of M$_2$X$_3$ $\beta$ structures using supercell models reveals that Mo$_2$X$_3$ relaxes into a different lower energy configuration. Our findings unveil the rich and complex structural and electronic landscape of anti-MXenes, which warrant further exploration of this class of materials.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary for \"The stability and electronic structure of anti-MXenes\"", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688c37ab23be8e43d6333d4b/original/supplementary-for-the-stability-and-electronic-structure-of-anti-m-xenes.pdf"}]</p></details> |

A case study of incalculably large chemical space coverage around the NLRP3 target](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68906171fc5f0acb52adf532/original/molecular-legion-latent-enumeration-generation-integration-optimization-and-navigation-a-case-study-of-incalculably-large-chemical-space-coverage-around-the-nlrp3-target.pdf)** | 2025-08-07 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-h10tn | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration and mapping of chemical space – the vast, multidimensional set of all small organic molecules – remains a central challenge in modern drug discovery. Traditional compound libraries and databases cover only a minute fraction of this space, limiting the discovery of novel, bioactive, and patentable chemotypes. Here, we present LEGION, an advanced workflow that integrates generative AI, AI-guided screening, and state-of-the-art cheminformatics tools within the Chemistry42 platform to enable comprehensive, large-scale exploration of chemical space around specific drug targets. Using NLRP3, a clinically relevant but structurally complex inflammasome protein, as a case study, LEGION combined ligand- and structure-based design strategies, in-house algorithms for 3D pharmacophore-aware scaffold extraction, and distinct library enumeration methods to identify over 34,000 unique scaffolds and generate approximately 110 million molecular structures. Iterative stages of 2D and 3D filtering, including machine learning and structure-based pharmacophore scoring, ensured the binding relevance and structural feasibility of the enumerated compounds. The resulting workflow proved effective for scaffold hopping, navigating unexplored regions of chemical space, and supporting intellectual property applications through the generation of structurally diverse and synthetically tractable structures. This work demonstrates, for the first time, an AI-enabled framework capable of both massive virtual screening and de novo compound generation, specifically tailored for extensive chemical space coverage around a biological target. LEGION establishes a new paradigm for the intelligent, scalable, and practical exploration of chemical space in drug discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

We present SPACESHIP, an AI-driven framework for dynamic, constraint-free exploration of synthesizable regions in chemical parameter spaces. SPACESHIP integrates probabilistic models and uncertainty-aware acquisition to learn from both successful and failed experiments to adaptively refine feasible synthesis conditions. A central feature is the Autopilot strategy, which dynamically selects between models and achieves up to 4.3× faster exploration than does random sampling. When applied to gold (Au) nanoparticle (NP) and nanorod (NR) synthesis, SPACESHIP identified synthesizable regions with 90% accuracy in only 23 experiments and reached 97% accuracy within 127 experiments—substantially fewer than the 625 experiments required to establish the ground truth. This method also enables the ternary classification of Au NRs on the basis of their optical properties, revealing distinct growth regimes. Compared with literature-based maps, SPACESHIP expanded the validated synthesizable space by a factor of 8 for NPs and 4 for NRs, supporting scalable discovery and mechanistic insight.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Robotics; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information for SPACESHIP: synthesizable parameter acquisition via closed-loop exploration and self-directed, hardware-aware intelligent protocols for autonomous lab", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689038cafc5f0acb52a7c6d7/original/supplementary-information-for-spaceship-synthesizable-parameter-acquisition-via-closed-loop-exploration-and-self-directed-hardware-aware-intelligent-protocols-for-autonomous-lab.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, their adoption by the general scientific community has been limited due to the cost of automation, such as instrumentation and laboratory infrastructure. In this work, we demonstrate the utilization of a centralized (semi-)automated lab as a cost-effective and accessible platform to democratize autonomous research. Specifically, by integrating a remote automated lab with artificial intelligence (AI), we developed a workflow called autoHSP, to demonstrate an autonomous and closed-loop determination of Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSPs) via batch-mode active learning (BMAL), without the need for any hands-on instrumentation setups. We developed algorithms to design experiments and analyze experiment outcomes, while outsourcing the experimentation to the automated lab remotely. A server was set up to handle communication between the automated lab and the AI framework securely with encryption. The lab received instructions and executed the experimental protocols to prepare the requested samples and report their images as characterization results. Then, a computer vision (CV) algorithm hosted on the server analyzed the images to determine the experiment outcome, and the BMAL algorithm selected solvents to optimize experiment design based on the most recent experimental knowledge until the end of experiment (EOE). Together, these demonstrate that this autonomous workflow can be adapted for general research where researchers can focus innovations on the AI-based software design.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688acaf1fc5f0acb52f74d3c/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

To advance the ability of machine learning to go beyond the “edge” of their training chemical space, we introduce a joint modeling approach that combines molecular property prediction with molecular reconstruction. This approach allows the introduction of unfamiliarity, a novel reconstruction-based metric that enables the estimation of model generalizability. Via a systematic analysis spanning more than 30 bioactivity datasets, we demonstrate that unfamiliarity not only effectively identifies out-of-distribution molecules but also serves as a reliable predictor of classifier performance. Even when faced with the presence of strong distribution shifts on large-scale molecular libraries, unfamiliarity yields robust and meaningful molecular insights that go unnoticed by traditional methods. Finally, we experimentally validate unfamiliarity-based molecule screening in the wet lab for two clinically relevant kinases, discovering seven compounds with low micromolar potency, and limited similarity to training molecules. This demonstrates that unfamiliarity can extend the reach of machine learning beyond the edge of the charted chemical space, advancing the discovery of diverse and structurally novel molecules.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Traditional materials development pipelines typically require 10-20 years, but self-driving laboratories (SDLs) and Materials Acceleration Platforms (MAPs) aim to reduce this to 1-2 years through closed-loop systems combining physical experimentation with computational intelligence. The review analyzes critical components including robotic hardware architectures, integrated analytical instrumentation, closed-loop optimization strategies, AI-driven decision-making frameworks, and multi-agent systems for laboratory coordination. Case studies demonstrate remarkable success across various domains: nanomaterials synthesis, inorganic materials exploration, electrocatalyst discovery, and reaction mechanism elucidation. Large language models have recently enhanced these systems by improving knowledge extraction, experimental planning, and multi-agent coordination. The integration of standardized data formats, accessible materials databases, and sophisticated knowledge representation frameworks further accelerates discovery while enhancing reproducibility. This transformative paradigm represents a fundamental reimagining of materials science methodology, shifting from human-guided exploration to AI-orchestrated discovery campaigns.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Robotics | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Variants of this approach have been used to parameterize classical force fields and machine learning potentials yet there are few readily available, purpose-built software packages to perform fragment-based calculations.  To fill this void we introduce FRAGMENT, an open-source software application that provides a platform for community validation of energy-based fragmentation methods, and a framework for developing new approximations.  FRAGMENT includes algorithms for automatic fragment generation and  structure modification, and for distance- and energy-based screening of the requisite subsystems.  Checkpointing, database management, and parallelization are  handled internally and results are archived into a portable database format;  FRAGMENT is also designed as a framework to examine and query that database.  Interfaces are provided to quantum chemistry engines including Q-Chem, PySCF, xTB, Orca, CP2K, MRCC, Psi4, NWChem, GAMESS, and MOPAC.  Applications reported here demonstrate parallel efficiencies up to 96% on more than 1,000 processors but also showcase that the code can handle large-scale protein fragmentation using only workstation hardware. FRAGMENT conforms to modern software development best practices and  is built upon well established technologies including Python, SQLite, and Ray. The source code is available under the Apache 2.0 license.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

TorchANI 2.0 builds upon the foundation of its predecessor, while addressing its limitations and introducing new features. These changes greatly enhance its extensibility, performance, and suitability as a framework for developing models ready for molecular dynamics applications. These improvements include the introduction of a modular system to add arbitrary pairwise potentials to models, CUDA-accelerated optimization for faster and more memory-efficient calculation of local atomic features, and a batched system for better performance of network ensembles, among others. Our benchmarks demonstrate that TorchANI 2.0 achieves significant speedup over previous versions in both training and inference, and the library enhancements allow users to train physically constrained models that better represent important qualities of chemical systems. We demonstrate this by introducing three new ANI models that incorporate these features and evaluating their capabilities</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6890e25e728bf9025ef53f41/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Knowing how a solute will dissolve in different solvents and at different temperatures is essential for drug formulation, synthesis, purification, and crystallization. Hard-to-estimate solubility limits currently hinder the design of new processes, making innovation more expensive. We propose a fast and general method for predicting the solubilities of neutral organic molecules in a wide range of solvents and temperatures. Our method uses a thermodynamic fusion cycle to combine machine learning predictions of the activity coefficient, fusion enthalpy, and melting point temperature. This method was tested on a combined dataset with more than 100,000 experimental solubility values, showing better or comparable performance to competing methods on many solubility benchmarks even at elevated temperatures. We also introduce reference ensembling to leverage all available experimental solubilities for a given solute in estimating its solubility in a different solvent. Reference ensembling is also shown to enhance the robustness of models trained directly on solubility data.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Pharmaceutical Industry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Accurately predicting solubility curves via a thermodynamic cycle, machine learning, and solvent ensembles", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688e50defc5f0acb52744616/original/supporting-information-accurately-predicting-solubility-curves-via-a-thermodynamic-cycle-machine-learning-and-solvent-ensembles.pdf"}]</p></details> |

In this force field, the intermolecular interaction is calculated based on  tted electron charge density, while the intramolecular energy is modeled using a traditional atomic-structure-based machine learning force  field model. The electron density of the molecular charge is represented by spherical charges centered at atoms and bond centers. The intermolecular interaction energy is calculated through the Coulomb interaction, exchange correlation interaction and Thomas-Fermi van Weiszaker kinetic energy, all based on the electron charge density. A polarization model is also introduced based on the local electric potentials near the atoms calculated based on the charge density. These interaction energies are combined to form the density based machine learning force field (DB-ML-FF). We show that the DB-ML-FF can accurately represent the intermolecular interaction, and it is practical to use this linear scaling model to carry out large system molecular dynamics simulations despite the fact the charge density is evaluated on a numerical grid.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Main limitations of currently existing methods for XANES quantitative analysis are (1) high demand of computational resources needed, (2) lack of universality of ML models between absorption edges, (3) absence of chemical and physical constraints, (4) low specificity for real catalytical cases. To address them simultaniously in an unified framework we introduce the DeepFit, a deep learning approach for physically and chemically informed on-the-fly XANES spectra analysis. By constructing the tmXAS—a comprehensive database of 67,000 possible local atomic environments and their corresponding Ab-initio K-edge XAS spectra for all 3d and 4d transition metals—we leverage a state-of-the-art universal deep learning model for rapid spectral prediction. This approach incorporates physical constraints through equivariance, ensuring consistency with fundamental symmetries. Then, combining quantum chemistry and DeepFit neural network differentiation, we implement an approach for chemically informed atomic structure refinement, capable of $3D$ structure prediction considering both spectroscopic and energetic favorability. Domain-specific spectroscopic solutions were put in the tmXAS database and DeepFit approach to better work with often overlooked in analysis methods and highly relevant cases of homogeneous and single-site/single-atom catalysts. The method's validity for both structure refinement and spectra prediction is rigorously demonstrated with several benchmarks, including structure unraveling of the Rh-complex homogeneous hydroformylation catalyst and well-defined 3d/4d metal coordination compounds (Cu, Co, Zn, Ni), where quantitative agreement with single-crystal XRD and EXAFS is met. By unifying physical constraints with computational efficiency, DeepFit establishes a new universal method for rapid XANES analysis with chemical plausibility and spectroscopic agreement being systematically encoded into efficient gradient-driven optimization.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Machine Learning; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

All-atom (AA) simulations provide fine resolution, but are computationally infeasible for large systems over longer durations. Coarse-grained (CG) and ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) models have a lower resolution and computational cost while still being able to conserve essential protein features. Prior work on a Multiscale Machine-learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI) combined both AA and CG simulations to study RAS-RAF protein interactions, leveraging CG models for longer timescales and using AA to investigate unusual conformations in greater detail. However, MuMMI is still resource-intensive, and this study aims to maximize exploration of the protein conformational space while reducing computational cost. In this paper, we build on prior work that integrates UCG models based on heterogeneous elastic network modeling (hENM) into the MuMMI workflow. We demonstrate that UCG models enable accurate sampling of protein conformations, focusing on simulating RAS-RAF protein interactions. Using higher-resolution CG Martini simulation data, we can automatically refine intramolecular interactions in UCG models. We present a scalable Python package that uses fluctuations observed in higher-resolution CG Martini simulations to estimate bond coefficients of the UCG model. We built novel machine learning-based backmapping methods to recover more detailed CG Martini structures from UCG structures, using diffusion models to learn the mapping between scales. Finally, we present UCG-mini-MuMMI, an accessible and less compute-intensive version of MuMMI as a resource for the scientific community. Incorporating UCG models into MD studies is applicable to a broad range of systems and proteins, and our study offers insights into the advantages and limitations of these methods.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Most of the current machine learning interatomic potentials do not distinguish between different spin states, making them unsuitable for open-shell reactive chemistry. Here we present AIMNet2-NSE (Neural Spin-charge Equilibration), a neural network potential that incorporates spin-charge equilibration for accurate treatment of molecules and reactions with arbitrary charge and spin multiplicities. Built upon the AIMNet2 framework, AIMNet2-NSE is trained on an extensive dataset comprising 20 million closed-shell neutral and charged molecules, 13 million open-shell radical configurations, and 200,000 radical reaction profiles. With explicit handling of spin charges, AIMNet2-NSE enables prediction of spin-resolved properties with near-DFT accuracy while offering five orders of magnitude computational speedup.

This functional, referred to as cQTP25, differs from other Quantum Theory Project (QTP) functionals by optimizing the range-separation parameters through a targeted restriction of the orbital space to core 1s electrons only. We benchmarked cQTP25 against a diverse set of XC functionals spanning multiple rungs of Jacob's ladder in Density Functional Theory (DFT). Performance was evaluated primarily using the relation $IP_{1s} = -\varepsilon_{1s}$, but for completeness, we also computed core ionization potentials using the $\Delta$DFT method. All calculations accounted for both non-relativistic and relativistic corrections. In general, regardless of the computational approach or test set, the results consistently show the same trend: cQTP25 delivers the best performance, followed closely by QTP00 and then QTP17.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: cQTP25: A New Exchange-Correlation Functional for Core-Electron Ionization Energy", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6891887dfc5f0acb52cc774f/original/supporting-information-c-qtp25-a-new-exchange-correlation-functional-for-core-electron-ionization-energy.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Conventional Optical Circular Dichroism spectroscopy often overlooks subtle and localized structural features. Here, we computationally investigate site-specific X-ray Circular Dichroism (XCD) across a series of trans-azobenzene derivatives to deconstruct and interpret chiroptical signals at the atomic level. Our modeling reveals that XCD is capable of distinguishing dichroic contributions arising from both a local chiral center and global molecular twist, revealing their intricate interplay and potential for constructive or destructive interference. We show that sterically-induced global distortions can dominate the XCD signal in some cases, even suppressing the response from the chiral center itself. This insight suggests a new molecular design principle for tuning chiroptical activity, which we extend by proposing strategies to achieve unidirectional photoisomerization through steric gearing. Altogether, this work establishes a quantitative framework for engineering chiroptical responses, laying the foundation for the design of functional chiral systems utilizing principles of unidirectional molecular motor-like conformational dynamics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information - Deconstructing Chirality: Probing Local and Non-local Effects in Azobenzene Derivatives with X-ray Circular Dichroism", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6892903223be8e43d6e9a8eb/original/supporting-information-deconstructing-chirality-probing-local-and-non-local-effects-in-azobenzene-derivatives-with-x-ray-circular-dichroism.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Among them, boroloborinines, a fused borole–borinine scaffold, constitute a rare class of 8π-electron antiaromatic systems with potential applications in organic electronics. However, their inherent instability has limited synthetic exploration and practical deployment. In this work, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to systematically investigate strategies for stabilizing boroloborinine derivatives via nitrogen incorporation and selective benzannulation. Photochemical stability is evaluated using HOMO–LUMO and singlet–triplet (S–T) energy gaps, while aromaticity is assessed through three classes of indices: the multicenter index (MCI), the Harmonic Oscillator Model of Aromaticity (HOMA), and magnetically induced ring currents. Our findings show that both the position and nature of substitution critically influence electronic structure, with the formation of Clar’s sextets correlating strongly with increased stability. Molecules that exhibit reduced antiaromaticity in the singlet state and minimal aromaticity in the triplet state tend to possess the largest S–T gaps. These insights provide guiding principles for designing antiaromatic chromophores with enhanced stability and tunable optoelectronic properties, potentially enabling the development of novel organic emitters with distinct emission wavelengths and improved quantum yields.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Material", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6890691e728bf9025ee978f3/original/supplementary-material.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, direct comparison of the accuracies of these methods is oftentimes challenging due to differences in studied systems, simulation parameters and system setup across studies. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel and well-defined model system for benchmarking water sampling methods: a closed, custom-defined C90 fullerene. Unlike conventional fullerenes with nonpolar, hydrophobic cavities, our custom-defined fullerene incorporates partial charges creating a polar cavity that energetically favors water binding. Due to a significant free energy barrier imposed by the fullerene wall, water exchange between the cavity and bulk solvent is essentially impossible on MD timescales.  To allow solvent water to equilibrate in the cavity, we introduce a solvent inlet, by performing Hamiltonian replica exchange (i.e., HREX) simulations, which reveal that our polar fullerene cavity can accommodate a maximum of two waters. From these HREX simulations, we also identify the binding sites of waters and their occupancies inside the cavity, which show that fullerene conformations with 2 or 1 waters inside the cavity are dominant, with nearly equal free energies. We further validate a non-equilibrium switching (NES) protocol for calculating the free energy of displacing a water from the conformations with 2 waters inside the cavity. Our NES results agree within statistical error with those obtained from HREX.  Our findings establish the polar fullerene as a well-defined reproducible test system for rigorously benchmarking current as well as future enhanced sampling techniques targeting slow water sampling in confined environments. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Despite its potential, the reaction mechanism, particularly the formation and the nature of nitrenoid species and the effects of axial ligands, still lacks understanding. Herein, we report a theoretical study on the unprotected nitrenoid C(sp3)−H insertion using three iron-porphyrin complexes with distinct axial coordination environments. Our study reveals the formation of two reactive nitrenoid intermediates, [FeNH2]+ and [FeNH], and elucidates their divergent mechanistic pathways and reactivity profiles. Notably, the [FeNH2]+ species exists an unprecedented σ-channel/σ-channel reaction pattern, and exhibits an atypical radical rebound mechanism. Furthermore, we developed a multivariate linear regression (MLR) model for the hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) step, identifying key factors governing reaction activity. Our study uncovers the critical role of axial ligands in modulating the stability and reactivity of iron-nitrenoid species, thereby steering the preferred reaction pathway in iron porphyrin-catalyzed C(sp3)−H amination. In addition, QM/MM calculations on the P411APA system unveil that the [FeNH2]⁺ pathway is more favorable, supporting its role as the active aminating species in the enzymatic nitrenoid C(sp3)−H insertion reactions. These mechanistic insights provide a valuable foundation for future catalyst design and protein engineering efforts.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Biocatalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Qualitatively correct electronic structures generally require large active space multireference wave functions, while dynamic correlation effects beyond the active space are crucial for quantitatively accurate descriptions of magnetic, catalytic and optical properties of such systems. Here, we present an uncontracted multireference perturbation theory based on the FCIQMC imaginary-time evolution of effective Hamiltonians, built upon the generalized active space concept and Löwdin’s partitioning technique. The configurational interaction space is split into a reference space, consisting of the most important configurations, and a perturber space, containing the more numerous configurations responsible for dynamic correlation effects. The generalized active space algorithm allows the flexible partitioning of the configurational space. Löwdin’s partitioning technique is then used to construct an effective Hamiltonian which is stochastically solved. This strategy allows us to apply perturbative corrections on large active space reference wave functions, without requiring high-order reduced density matrices, which have been found the bottleneck in other perturbation theory strategies. The capabilities of the resulting method, called Stochastic-SplitGAS, are demonstrated on the triplet-quintet spin gap of an Fe(II)-porphyrin model system and the spin ladder of a [Fe(III)2S2]2– complex.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |
