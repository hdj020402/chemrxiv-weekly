The chemical similarity among these elements makes the development of selective solvent extraction reagents both slow and difficult. Here, we present a quasi-autonomous, AI-enabled workflow for the design and computational screening of selective extractant ligands. Molecular design is guided by SAFE-MolGen, a large language model-based agentic system that leverages curated extraction data to propose new ligands and preliminarily rank their performance using a supervised machine learning model trained on experimental datasets to consider the impact of realistic experimental conditions. Promising human-approved ligands are then passed to a second automated pipeline that constructs three-dimensional metal-ligand complexes and performs quantum mechanical free energy calculations to directly assess metal selectivity. We demonstrate this approach for Am(III)/Eu(III) separations and report several newly designed ligands predicted to exhibit higher Am(III)/Eu(III) selectivity than the benchmark extractant CyMe4BTBP. This workflow accelerates computational exploration of the molecular space in this data-sparse field and provides a general strategy for the rapid generation and evaluation of novel lanthanide (Ln) and actinide (An) extractants. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Lanthanides and Actinides; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/694855afafb3b111188a4255/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Active learning with Gaussian processes has enabled efficient phase diagram mapping, reducing required measurements by approximately 80\% compared to conventional grid sampling. However, current approaches treat each system independently, discarding accumulated knowledge despite systematic similarities across related materials families. Here we introduce PhaseTransfer, a transfer learning framework that leverages previously characterized phase diagrams to accelerate mapping of new systems. PhaseTransfer combines a target model trained on current data with source models from related diagrams using spatially varying reliability assessments and focusing sampling on regions where transferred knowledge proves unreliable. Validation across synthetic benchmarks and experimental implementation on an autonomous microfluidic platform for biological condensate screening demonstrates in the order of 50\% reduction in sampling requirements compared to conventional active learning. By enabling knowledge reuse across investigations, transfer learning substantially enhances both the efficiency and generality of autonomous materials discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information for: PhaseTransfer", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6945344aafb3b11118180b97/original/supplementary-information-for-phase-transfer.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Li-Argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) is a promising SSE with high ionic conductivity, produced using cheap and sustainable precursors, and therefore of interest to both academia and industry. Like many other sulfide-based SSEs, it is however unstable against Li-metal. Using ab-initio and machine-learning methods, we simulate three representative Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interface models to investigate whether the exact surface termination affects the chemical stability and ion transport capability. We present a systematic approach to create low-energy interfaces by screening 28 low Miller-index surface terminations of Li-argyrodite and coupling them with Li-metal. Custom-made machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ab-initio data enable the simulation of large interface models with over 2000 atoms for 5 ns. We find that all three interfaces decompose into an amorphous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, consisting of Li3P, Li2S and LiCl, which then crystallizes into an antifluorite phase Li2S{1-x-y}P{x}Cl{y}; {x,y = 0.14-0.15}. A two orders of magnitude decrease in Li-ion flux shows that the crystalline SEI layer is a sluggish ion conductor, similar to Li2S. While all three interfaces form the same crystalline SEI layer, the exact rates of the decomposition and crystallisation depend on the actual surface composition. These atomic-level insights could potentially be used to control the SEI formation in sulphide-based SSEs and others.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information for Atomistic insights into the chemical stability and ionic transport at Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interfaces", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/694bc816afb3b111180cfb12/original/supplementary-information-for-atomistic-insights-into-the-chemical-stability-and-ionic-transport-at-li-metal-li-argyrodite-interfaces.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This paper revives HSP-based algorithm design by examining new group structures with direct relevance to post-quantum cryptography, lattice problems, and structured optimization. We classify a family of finite and continuous groups-extensions and semi-direct products of abelian groups, matrix groups, and certain non-abelian groups-according to their Fourier-theoretic properties and the feasibility of efficient quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs). For each class, we determine whether the HSP admits an efficient quantum algorithm, a subexponential-time quantum algorithm, or appears intractable even quantumly. We construct explicit algorithms for eight new problem families, including structured lattice enumeration, automorphism groups of certain graphs, and algebraic attack primitives appearing in code-based and multivariate cryptosystems. For these, we show superpolynomial quantum speedups over all known classical approaches under standard complexity assumptions. We also discuss how approximate and block-encoded QFTs can be combined with variational post-processing to make some of these HSP algorithms more NISQ-friendly. Our results demonstrate that algebraic-structure-based quantum algorithms remain a rich and underexploited direction with both theoretical depth and potential cryptanalytic and optimization applications.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Successful drug candidates should have optimal aqueous solubility to improve bioavailability to target tissues. To effectively screen molecules in a short period of time, reliable predictive models are highly useful. In the present study, we conducted a round-robin exercise using a large, curated dataset of over 6000 compounds to predict aqueous solubility quantitatively. The six participating groups used an array of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to develop models with strong robustness and external predictive performance. All the models underwent rigorous Leave-One-Out and 10-fold cross-validation. The diversity of training sets and descriptor types used by different groups paved the way for exploring the mechanistic basis for the efficient identification of contributing features. The best-performing model was selected using the statistical Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) approach, considering the performances on training, cross-validation, and test, as well as the performance difference between the training and test sets. Additionally, a curated, true external set was screened by the six different models. Here, the best-performing model was selected using a consensus ranking strategy based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R_Ext^2. In both approaches, i.e., the inherent model performance in terms of training, test, and cross-validation statistics, and the ability of the model to efficiently predict true external data, the Stacking Ensemble of Deep q-RASPR model emerged as the winner. This model showed comparable predictive performance to the previously reported model, which apparently lacked a proper data curation workflow and contained a significant number of duplicates and mixtures in its dataset, which can inflate model statistics. The insights from the different feature contributions from the different groups identified the useful structural and physicochemical aspects, which can help synthetic chemists to optimize molecules.  </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Files", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69410b28afb3b111185b998d/original/supplementary-files.zip"}]</p></details> |

We present a computationally efficient approach to cross-geometry pretraining for molecular systems that improves transfer learning performance within severe computational constraints (single GPU, <100 GPU-hours). Using hybrid EGNN-PaiNN architecturesand strategic pretraining on diverse molecular geometries from QM9 and MD17 datasets, we achieve 47% average improvement in few-shot force prediction compared to training from scratch. Our methodology demonstrates that effective geometry transfer can be achieved through careful dataset sampling and multi-task learning strategies, even under limited computational budgets. We provide complete code and reproducible training protocols to facilitate adoption by resource-constrained research groups. While current experiments focus on small organic molecules, the approach establishes a foundation for extending equivariant pretraining to broader molecular systems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Recent deep learning models, particularly LAGOM, have significantly improved metabolite prediction by framing it as a direct SMILES-to-SMILES translation, setting a new benchmark for this challenging one-to-many problem. Building on this, this study introduces MetaSense, an enhanced Transformer model designed for more precise and diverse metabolite generation. MetaSense integrates a novel Structure-Aware Attention (SAA) mechanism within its encoder to identify potential metabolic sites by modulating attention weights with local structural features. Concurrently, an Adaptive Diversity Beam Search (ADBS) strategy is employed in the decoder to optimize the generation of multiple, diverse, and chemically plausible metabolites through dynamic diversity penalties and online chemical validity filtering. Evaluated on the independent GLORYx external test set, MetaSense consistently outperforms LAGOM, achieving a higher F-one score, Recall, and Precision, with a comparable total number of predictions. These results validate the effectiveness of SAA and ADBS, demonstrating MetaSense's enhanced capability to provide more accurate, diverse, and chemically valid metabolite predictions, thereby offering a more practical and reliable tool for drug discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

potential energy surfaces for molecular systems with very high accuracy and extreme speedups compared

systems. This work presents the LAMMPS-ANI interface, which scales our ANI neural network potential
models for large systems, demonstrated with up to 100 million atoms across up to 128 NVIDIA A100

in-depth performance profiling, and advanced GPU performance optimizations. Our benchmarks show
that ANI is 30 to 60 times faster than the state-of-the-art Allegro Model, emphasizing its speed and
efficiency. We highlight our work in large-scale molecular dynamics using ANI potentials, presenting
benchmark results for water boxes (up to 100 million atoms) and a solvated HIV capsid (44 million
atoms). We also present results for accurately simulating complex reaction processes at unprecedented

A systematic model comparison was performed using a carefully curated dataset, where LightGBM demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy with RMSE value of 8.381 for %ee. SHAP based interpretability analysis clarified which steric, electronic and geometrical descriptors most strongly influence facial selectivity across these reduc- tions.

We introduce Probabilistic Forecasting for Coarse-Graining (PFCG), a machine learning framework that learns stochastic coarse-grained equations of motion directly from atomistic trajectories by formulating coarse-grained simulation as a probabilistic time-series forecasting problem with both Markovian and non-Markovian contributions. PFCG incorporates non-Markovian effects through finite trajectory history without requiring explicit memory kernels or learned effective potentials. We apply PFCG to miniproteins and polyalanine peptides and evaluate both configurational and dynamical fidelity using free energy surfaces, autocorrelation functions, and transition timescales from Markov state models. Across all systems, non-Markovian PFCG models significantly improve dynamical agreement with atomistic simulation relative to Markovian baselines while also maintaining excellent agreement with stationary distributions. These results highlight the importance of inductive biases at the level of equations of motion and establish PFCG as a complementary approach to existing machine learning-based coarse-graining methods for modeling biomolecular processes.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6946195fafb3b1111837048f/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

In this work, we demonstrate how recently developed gradient-based optimization methods can substantially accelerate the refinement of CG force field (FF) parameters within the Martini framework, a cornerstone of modern CG modeling. Using Martini lipid models as a testbed, we explore three increasingly challenging optimization problems. First, a single phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid, where we optimize bonded parameters by fitting simultaneously to top-down membrane observables (area per lipid, bilayer thickness, and transition temperature) and bottom-up atomistic bond and angle distributions. We then scale the workflow to eight different PC lipids, demonstrating robust performance in a complex multi-system landscape and an order-of-magnitude reduction in computational cost relative to population-based heuristic schemes. Finally, to evaluate performance in higher-dimensional parameter spaces, we additionally optimize the non-bonded parameters of the solvent-free Dry Martini FF, demonstrating that the method scales effectively with increasing numbers of adjustable parameters. Collectively, these results suggest that the large, expert-coordinated workflows that have historically characterized the parameterization of community-driven CG models like Martini can be efficiently streamlined by fully automated, objective-driven gradient-based optimizations.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Biophysical Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69459ad1afb3b1111823bf0b/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Limited availability of biotransformation half-life data makes persistence prediction difficult, and models typically struggle to generalize beyond their training data. Therefore, reliable estimates of prediction confidence are key.  Here, we propose a probabilistic model for the prediction of soil biotransformation half-lives. A Gaussian Process Regressor was trained on 867 mean pesticide half-lives with data uncertainty estimates. Instead of single half-life values, our model predicts well-calibrated probability distributions that can be used to calculate a compound's probability of being persistent. Although the overall model performance remains moderate, the predictions are reliable when the confidence in the prediction is high.  We applied our model to pesticide transformation products with unknown half-lives, and to a database of globally marketed chemicals. We show that our model is able to identify chemicals that are known, or suspected to be, persistent in the environment. The model is available as an online app (https://pepper-app.streamlit.app/) and as a Python library (pepper-lab) to meet diverse user needs.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6945713a6e8e74030e774ad0/original/supporting-information.pdf"}, {"title": "Predictions for pesticide TPs", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6945713a6e8e74030e774ad7/original/predictions-for-pesticide-t-ps.csv"}, {"title": "Predictions for ZeroPM substances", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6945718be3cb457e13a67627/original/predictions-for-zero-pm-substances.csv"}]</p></details> |

Here, we address the development and benchmarking of both the Open Force Field (OpenFF) AshGC charge model, as well as the Sage 2.3.0 small molecule force field for drug-like molecules. AshGC is a graph neural network-based method for efficient assignment of charges to both small and large molecules, designed to produce charges of semi- empirical quality at low cost. We describe the model, its architecture, featurization, training process, and performance. AshGC largely generates charges within the range of other accepted AM1-BCC backends such as OpenEye’s oequacpac and AmberTools’ sqm, but we note areas of poor performance such as in smaller molecules and in charged molecules, as well as areas of chemistry underrepresented in the training set. We fur- ther describe the development and performance of Sage 2.3.0, where Lennard-Jones and valence parameters are re-trained with neural network charges for the first time. Our benchmark suite of common force field tasks ranges from optimizing molecular structures in vacuum to protein-ligand binding free energies. Overall, Sage 2.3.0 performs comparably to previous Sage force fields, although we report minor improvements in the prediction of condensed phase properties and a minor decrease in performance in the prediction of non-aqueous solvation free energies. As with other OpenFF force fields, Sage 2.3.0 was validated in protein-ligand benchmarks to be compatible with Amber protein force fields. All data are publicly available, along with scripts, environments, and complete details for reproducing the training and benchmarking of AshGC and Sage 2.3.0 at https://github.com/openforcefield/ashgc-v1.0-fit and github.com/openforcefield/ash-sage-rc2 respectively.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information for: Developing and benchmarking Sage 2.3.0 with the AshGC neural network charge model", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6940accabc44e47cf41a835f/original/supporting-information-for-developing-and-benchmarking-sage-2-3-0-with-the-ash-gc-neural-network-charge-model.pdf"}]</p></details> |

In view of the tremendous progress in atomically precise metal nanoclusters where electrochemical and optical energetics are routinely supported by computations to establish structure-function correlations, we explore the relationship between different protocols for measuring and computing band gaps of two distinct organic ligand-protected nanoclusters: [Cu14H10(MBN)3(PPh3)8]+ and Au20(TBBT)16. Through UV/visible spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry, we measure optical and electrochemical band gaps in those systems. We then compare these experimental gaps to HOMO-LUMO gaps, fundamental gaps, vertical excitation energies, and Eox - Ered potentials computed using density functional theory (DFT) or time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). We test functionals with varying degrees of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange from 0% to 50%, different correlation functionals, basis sets, and (equilibrium and non-equilibrium) continuum solvation models. We find that in both copper and gold nanoclusters, the most important factor affecting the magnitude of the band gap is the % HF exchange, which in the case of the HOMO-LUMO gap can vary by several eV. This sensitivity is partially mitigated when computing the fundamental, optical, and electrochemical gaps. The second most important factor is the proper description of solvation effects. Other factors, such as the nature of the correlation functional, basis set, and geometry relaxation, have a considerably smaller effect on computed band gaps in these systems.

We compare this approach with the length gauge (LG) formalism that we presented in a previous work [APL Comp. Phys. 1, 026107 (2025)] in terms of theoretical analysis and computational results. Calculations on molecular systems with large Dunning basis sets including diffuse functions show a smooth convergence towards the complete basis set limit (CBS) with both formalisms, but LG and MVG converge to different values when CCSD provides an incomplete treatment of electron correlation. With the  small basis sets used in the PBC calculations, the difference between the gauge formalisms increases due to basis set incompleteness. For the PBC calculations on 1D periodic systems, the MVG formalism shows a faster convergence towards the thermodynamic limit with $k$ sampling compared to LG. Furthermore, the MVG formalism provides perfect agreement between PBC and long molecular cluster models. This is not the case for LG due to the so-called missing integer issue. However, a comparison with the molecular data suggests that the LG-PBC results with the small basis set affordable in this work are closer to the CBS results than those with MVG. This work represents a further step forward for the simulation of optical response properties for solid-state materials with systematically improvable quantum mechanical methods.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/694aaafde3cb457e13692fdd/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

We recently demonstrated that a nitrile’s      (–C≡N) infrared (IR) transition dipole moment (TDM) and anomalous H-bond frequency blueshift can report on its environmental electric field and H-bond geometry and dynamics, respectively. Here, we expand on prior work with nitriles site-selectively incorporated into photoactive yellow protein by introducing mutations designed to alter local nitrile H-bonding and electrostatics. A comprehensive analysis combining IR data, high-resolution X-ray crystal structures, and extensive molecular dynamics simulations demonstrates that the multipolar, polarizable AMOEBA force field accurately models electrostatics and H-bond geometries in both fast and slow H-bond exchange regimes. This finding is reached by correlating experimentally and computationally derived –C≡N electric fields and H-bond blueshifts exhibiting different H-bond fluctuation timescales. This implies that AMOEBA correctly models thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of noncovalent interactions. The diverse, thoroughly characterized collection of –C≡N protein environments reported herein provide a benchmark for next-generation molecular dynamics force fields that incorporate higher level descriptions of molecular electrostatics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Biophysical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69460e026e8e74030e8de006/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

In this work, we explore the performance of the recently developed parameterized quantum electrodynamics (pQED) approach based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) for non-covalently interacting systems, including van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions.  We find that the pQED-TDDFT approach accurately reproduces the cavity-modified potential energy surfaces of the polaritonic ground state, compared with high-level QED coupled-cluster and state-of-the-art QED density functional theory results. By computing the ground-state density difference, we show that the dispersion-energy modifications are due to electronic density redistribution inside the cavity. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |
