Traditional computational and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, which often operate on a single modality of data, are increasingly insufficient to capture the intricate, high-dimensional nature of molecular systems. This survey explores the transformative potential of multimodal AI, which integrates diverse data types, such as 3D structures, spectroscopic measurements, experimental images, and scientific text, to unlock deeper insights and accelerate discovery. We provide a comprehensive overview of how multimodal AI is revolutionizing three key domains: enhancing molecular visualization by creating context-rich, interactive representations; deepening the understanding of chemical reactions by fusing mechanistic and observational data; and accelerating material design through the inverse design of novel compounds with desired properties. We categorize and discuss foundational concepts, current state-of-the-art applications, and the significant challenges that remain. By synthesizing the latest advancements, this survey highlights the critical role of multimodal AI in pushing the frontiers of molecular science and charts a course for future research in this burgeoning field.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Traditional PK model offer mechanistic interpretability but often rely on rigid assumptions, extensive parameterization, limiting their scalability across structurally diverse compounds and heterogeneous patient populations. In this work, we propose Uni-PK, a unified neural framework that combines molecular representations with neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) embedded within a mechanistically grounded PK structure. Rather than solely predicting PK parameters, Uni-PK directly models the dynamic trajectory of drug concentrations from molecular and individual inputs, enabling end-to-end learning under data-scarce and noisy conditions. To account for inter-individual variability, we incorporate auxiliary covariates---such as species and dosing regimen---via a flexible context encoder, supporting personalized preclinical and clinical settings. Evaluated on rat and human datasets spanning multiple administration routes and physiological states, Uni-PK showed robust performance while remaining consistent with established pharmacokinetic principles. By integrating chemical structure and individual-specific information within a dynamic modeling framework, Uni-PK offers a scalable, interpretable, and animal-sparing solution for next-generation PK modeling and precision therapeutics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Docking](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691e3632a10c9f5ca19fd2df/original/fine-tuning-diff-dock-l-for-allosteric-kinase-docking.pdf)** | 2025-12-07 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b8k76 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Allosteric kinase inhibitors are an important modality for overcoming resistance and achieving
selectivity, yet most structure-based docking and deep generative models are trained predominantly on orthosteric protein–ligand complexes. As a result, current methods often misplace allosteric kinase ligands into the ATP-binding site and fail to recover the correct binding mode. Here we curate AlloSet, a kinome-wide, time-split dataset of kinase–ligand complexes annotated by binding mode, to systematically evaluate and fine-tune the diffusion-based docking model DiffDock-L for allosteric pose prediction. We explore several fine-tuning strategies, including increased dropout, freezing of torsion parameters with translation/rotation–only fine-tuning, and molecular dynamics (MD)–based supersampling of receptor conformations and ligand poses. The resulting DiffDock-L-Allo model is found to markedly improve pose-recovery metrics for Type III/IV allosteric inhibitors while preserving performance on ATP-site ligands. Binding mode–resolved evaluations and comparisons with co-folding models such as AlphaFold3 and Boltz-2 highlight how targeted retraining reshapes the generative model’s sampling distribution, offering practical guidance for adapting AI-driven docking to challenging, low-data binding modes in in kinase structure-based drug design.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691e37edef936fb4a27da3c7/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

(LBs) offer a metal-free platform for catalyzing a wide range of chemical transformations. Designing
the optimal FLP active site for a particular chemical reaction is a challenging task due to the lack
of rigorous principles and countless chemical possibilities. We recently designed principles, which
outline the relative disposition (i.e., distance and angle) and chemical composition of the LA and
LB centers that maximize activity in B- and N-based FLPs. These criteria were already used to
screen 25,000 FLP active sites built on N-containing linkers extracted from the CoRE MOF dataset,
but in such an enormous multifunctional catalyst space, inverse design approaches provide a more
efficient mean to explore all possible combinations. Here, we use the NaviCatGA genetic algorithm
to simultaneously optimize the chemical and geometrical characteristics of intramolecular FLPs while
considering synthetic complexity and catalyst quenching constraints. By integrating activity maps
and non-linear regression models, our workflow explores a vast chemical space of 1.7 billion FLP
candidates built from organic fragments curated from the literature — released as the open-source
FragFLP25 dataset— to identify optimal compositions suitable for catalytic CO2 hydrogenation.
Analyzing the top candidates extracted from various Pareto fronts in the catalyst space, we not only
uncover active FLP motifs for hydrogenation that have not been previously reported but also refine
and extend the design principles previously established from our high-throughput screening study.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Homogeneous Catalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Electronic Supplementary Information for Inverse Design of Frustrated Lewis Pairs for Direct Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation: Refining and Expanding Design Rules", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6929e912ef936fb4a21b3a7f/original/electronic-supplementary-information-for-inverse-design-of-frustrated-lewis-pairs-for-direct-catalytic-co2-hydrogenation-refining-and-expanding-design-rules.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Assessing this polypharmacology is essential for drug development. Here we trained deep neural networks to associate bioactive molecules up to 80 non-hydrogen atoms in size reported in ChEMBL 34, represented as binary substructure fingerprints, with lists of targets on which the molecules are 50% active at ≤10 µM. We included 2,496,555 interactions between 1,187,089 molecules and 7,546 targets having at least five reported active molecules, including single proteins, protein complexes, protein families, cell lines, organisms, and further target types. This represents a much larger dataset than previously reported models, which were mostly limited to protein targets. Our DNNs achieve good performance in terms of recall and precision per molecule and per target, as illustrated by overall statistics and by a case study in comparison with other online prediction tools. PPB3 predictions can be performed online at https://ppb3.gdb.tools/. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

A hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical/machine learning free-energy perturbation (QM/MM/ML-FEP) framework was employed to quantify solvent effects on the relative stabilization of surface intermediates and transition states. Microkinetic modeling reveals that the Alkoxy pathway is favored over the Hydroxy pathway across all environments—dry gas, co-fed water vapor, and liquid water. Water plays a dual mechanistic role: it directly promotes hydrogenation of the carbonyl oxygen via proton shuttling/hydrogen-atom transfer from adsorbed H2O/OH species, and it acts as a solvent that modulates the adsorption strength of surface intermediates and transition states. In the co-fed water vapor system, the second hydrogenation step proceeds through H-mediated (63%), H₂O-mediated (31%), and OH-mediated (5%) pathways, whereas in liquid water, the reaction occurs exclusively through the H₂O-mediated pathway, enhancing the overall turnover frequency by an order of magnitude and shifting the rate controlling step from the second to the first hydrogenation of the carbonyl carbon. These findings demonstrate that the enhanced activity of aqueous-phase Ru-catalyzed carbonyl hydrogenation arises from both the direct participation of water in the mechanism and its solvent-induced stabilization and destabilization of key surface states.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information for: Atomistic Insights into Aqueous Phase Carbonyl Hydrogenation over Ru Catalysts from a Hybrid QM/MM/ML Potential", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6920a437ef936fb4a2e84ab6/original/supporting-information-for-atomistic-insights-into-aqueous-phase-carbonyl-hydrogenation-over-ru-catalysts-from-a-hybrid-qm-mm-ml-potential.pdf"}, {"title": "Adsorbate and TS coordinates", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6920a47565a54c2d4af4705b/original/adsorbate-and-ts-coordinates.txt"}]</p></details> |

Mechanism-based in silico screening can address this shortcoming by predicting molecular initiating event activation. However, a limited amount protein-binding data has been collected on pesticides, meaning that for screening an approach is required that is well suited for extrapolation to a wide variety of chemicals. Here, the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) were taken as a case study because of their role in chemical-induced PD. Compounds with known activity for these receptors were docked into the allosteric binding site, interaction fingerprints (IFPs) were computed and used to train classification models. Afterward, model enrichment was evaluated, feature importance was derived, and the applicability domain was analyzed. Both IFP-based mGluR models demonstrated good enrichment with the 95% confidence interval of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) ranging between 0.71 to 0.85 and 0.84 to 0.91. The interactions that were most important for model predictions were hydrogen bond formation with Asn760 for mGluR1 and aromatic interactions with Trp785 for mGluR5. The applicability domain varied depending on the training set but was consistently larger for IFPs than for Morgan fingerprints a fragment-based descriptor. A virtual screen using the final models identified 132 potential mGluR binders of which one, bifenthrin, had been previously found to bind in in vitro experiments. To promote the implementation of the screening technique presented here, a platform was created where users can make predictions using our models. All in all, these results highlight the potential of combining IFPs with machine learning and contribute to the shift towards mechanism-based in silico toxicology.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

molecular systems based on quantum mechanics. It largely forms the basis for quantum-chemistry-based energy
calculation and has become the core concept of modern electronic structure theory.1 However, its complexity
increases exponentially with the number of interacting particles, and its exact solution remains intractable in
most cases. To bridge this gap, various approximation strategies have been developed, forming the basis of
modern quantum chemistry.1 Accurate approximation methods for the many-body Schrödinger equation enable
the solution of complex, otherwise intractable problems with enhanced accuracy and balanced computational
costs. This review focuses on the conceptual foundations of these approximation approaches, ranging from
mean-field theories, such as Hartree–Fock, through post–Hartree–Fock correlation methods, including
configuration interaction, perturbation theory, and coupled-cluster techniques, to the widely adopted density
functional theory and semi-empirical models; newly emerging methods such as quantum Monte Carlo, and
machine learning-augmented strategies would also be addressed.
2-8 The accuracy and efficiency were also
briefly mentioned for those approximation methods, highlighting the trade-offs between theoretical rigor and
computational feasibility. These approximation strategies for the many-body Schrödinger equation continue to
be central to quantum chemistry, enabling increasingly reliable predictions of molecular structure, energetics,
and dynamics with reduced computational costs.

From computations, the addition of diazoalkanes to the C=C of 6H-1,2-oxazine is kinetically and thermodynamically favored over addition to the C=N bond. On the addition to the C=C, the preferred step has an activation barrier of 12.4 kcal/mol with a corresponding rate constant of 5.05 x 103 s-1 which is about 12 times faster than the closest competing step within the same pathway. This step is also about 4.6 x 103 times faster than the lowest barrier in the unfavored pathway (addition to C=N bond). Substitution (sterically or electronically enhanced) on 6H-1,2-oxazine does not affect the selectivity and has no substantial effect on the rate but that on diazoalkane does greatly. The favored regioselectivity from the energetic trend is confirmed by the Parr function. The selectivity in this reaction is dictated by the electronic effect of groups on both reactants and not their steric effect.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

To accomplish this goal, we develop an extension of MASH using the ring-polymer (RP) formalism, which we term RP-MASH. Within RP-MASH, the nonadiabatic electronic transitions are described with explicit equations of motion using electronic mapping variables, while the nuclei are quantized through the RP Hamiltonian. The final equations of motion are fully deterministic, consistent with the original MASH formalism, and the entire RP follows a single adiabatic potential energy surface at all times. An electronic transition leads to all beads switching simultaneously to the new potential energy surface. We define two versions of RP-MASH, distinguished by whether the terms involving the nonadiabatic coupling vector are calculated as a bead-average over the positions of all beads or from the position of the centroid of the RP. We apply RP-MASH to Tully's avoided crossing models, internal conversion in the 3-mode model for pyrazine, and the spin-boson model for electron transfer. We find that MASH and RP-MASH perform similarly in the first two models when the initial state of the system is treated appropriately. In comparison, the electron transfer rate constants for the spin-boson model calculated using RP-MASH show a significant improvement over MASH. Taken together, the results indicate that explicit nuclear quantum effects are most relevant for thermally driven processes and that RP-MASH is a practical and useful simulation methodology to tackle such dynamics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

predicting the spontaneity of chemical reactions and the stability of molecular systems. Solvation free energy
ΔG𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 is a fundamental thermodynamic quantity that describes the free energy change associated with
transferring a solute from the gas phase into a solvent. It is particularly useful for estimating reaction rates and
pathways of organic reactions, most of which occur in the liquid phase, and has important applications in
organic synthesis, biochemistry, and drug discovery.1 The field has evolved significantly, moving from
foundational statistical mechanics methods such as Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) and Thermodynamic
Integration (TI) to more sophisticated multiscale and hybrid approaches.2,3 A central and persistent challenge
is the delicate balance between achieving high accuracy in quantum mechanical descriptions of electronic

report provides an overview of the theoretical frameworks, implementations, and predictive accuracy of
commonly used methods for calculating solvation free energy ΔG𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 , assessing alchemical methods,
quantum chemistry methods, hybrid QM/MM approaches, while also addressing practical considerations.
Finally, we examine the transformative role of emerging methods such as machine learning, which are poised
to accelerate these calculations, making rigorous, large-scale free energy simulations feasible and better
balancing the cost-accuracy trade-off that has long constrained the field.5,6

The approach is based on a formally exact, projection-based quantum embedding (PbE) technique that combines correlated many-electron wavefunction models for the molecular region with a Density Functional Theory (DFT) description of the metallic electrodes. This is achieved by constructing a specialized Hamiltonian for the molecular domain, leveraging Dyson orbitals corresponding to the ionized and electron-attached states of the embedded molecule. The effectiveness of this wavefunction-in-DFT (WFT-in-DFT) embedding scheme is demonstrated through transport calculations for SMJs containing benzene-1,4-diamine (BDA) and its substituted derivatives, employing Hartree–Fock, SOS-ADC(2), and CCSD methods for the molecular subsystem. The results show a marked improvement in the predicted zero-bias conductance compared to conventional DFT-based transport modeling employing the PBE functional. The proposed methodology provides a systematic way to select the most suitable electronic structure methods for the different parts of the system, maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational cost, while ensuring an proper description of electronic correlation within the molecule, which is believed to play an important role in electron transport.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Material", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69201bab65a54c2d4ae3f86a/original/supplementary-material.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, SA-CASSCF suffers from one Achilles heel, related to the description of ionic ππ∗ excited states, whose energy is often overestimated by 1–2 eV. In light of this challenge, we present the XS-CASSCF method, a new approach based on the idea of exchange scaling (XS) that screens the involved energy terms to improve the excitation energies of singlet ionic ππ∗ states. First, we illustrate the power of the XS-CASSCF method using hexatriene and para-quinodimethane as examples, showing that it corrects the targeted ionic states while leaving the other states largely unaffected, with root-mean-square errors (RMSE) below 0.2 eV for the four lowest states in both cases. Subsequently, XS-CASSCF vertical excitation energies are tested against theoretical best estimates for a set of 11 molecules and 56 excited states. We highlight that XS-CASSCF performs exceptionally well for the ππ∗ states of hydrocarbons reducing the RMSE over 21 excitation energies from 0.96 to 0.27 eV. We also study a more challenging test set including molecules with heteroatoms and a larger number of ππ∗ and nπ∗ states, finding that improvements can be obtained also in this case, albeit not as pronounced. Owing to notable improvements across significant classes of molecules combined with its conceptual simplicity, we believe that XS-CASSCF will be a prominent tool in the electronic structure toolbox, serving both as a standalone electronic structure method and as a starting point for further correlated treatment.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Data", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6920db90ef936fb4a2f36d9d/original/supplementary-data.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Established approaches for soluble ligands in enclosed cavities do not translate to lipophilic ligands on hydrophobic surfaces. These limitations impede efforts to resolve lipid-mediated mechanisms in transmembrane proteins. Here, we apply a formally exact computational method (Streamlined Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation, SAFEP) to calculate the absolute binding affinity of an anionic phospholipid for a potential modulatory site on a lipid-sensitive ion channel, using atomistic resolution. Specifically, we calculate the affinity of palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) at a cryo-EM–suggested site on the Erwinia ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC). Within a double-decoupling scheme, we calculate the POPG bulk chemical potential in palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC)/POPG mixtures and the decoupling free energy from the cryo-EM–suggested site. We extend the restraint scheme of SAFEP to flexible chains and calculate an affinity of -9.7 +/- 0.8 kcal/mol for binding modes in which the glycerol backbone of POPG aligns with the cryo-EM lipid density. This value is consistent with our previous relative binding affinity calculations, while reducing the statistical error by a factor of three and relaxing assumptions required for that calculation. Unbiased simulations reveal that when the backbone is bound, the headgroup can adopt at least two distinct conformations, each interacting with protein residues with established functional implications. The bulk chemical potentials indicate weak non-ideality, showing modest reductions in excess chemical potential at 10–30 mol% POPG; these values can be paired with single decoupling of POPG from any site to avoid recalculating membrane non-ideality. Overall, our results confirm high POPG affinity for this site and demonstrate SAFEP as a tractable route for quantifying absolute lipid–protein affinities for membrane proteins in mixed lipid bilayers.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information for Absolute Binding Affinity of a Phospholipid for a Membrane Protein", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6925be82ef936fb4a28bbd7a/original/supplementary-information-for-absolute-binding-affinity-of-a-phospholipid-for-a-membrane-protein.pdf"}]</p></details> |
