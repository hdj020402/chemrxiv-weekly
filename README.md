With the recent surge of AI and deep learning frameworks, it remains unclear whether these modern techniques offer statistically significant improvement over the well-established classical methods. The 2025 ASAP-Polaris-OpenADMET Antiviral Challenge provided a unique benchmarking opportunity to address this question, joined by over 65 teams of computational scientists worldwide. Our submissions were among the top performers in terms of Pearson r correlation, ranked first in pIC50 prediction for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and fourth in aggregated ADME.  In this work, we present a retrospective analysis of our modeling strategies and highlight our lessons learned. Through rigorous statistical benchmarking, we demonstrate that while classical methods remain highly competitive for predicting potency, modern deep learning algorithms significantly outperformed traditional machine learning in ADME prediction. We also illustrate the importance of appropriate data curation and the benefits of leveraging public datasets via feature augmentation. Finally, we outline current limitations and identify future opportunities, including the integration of structure-guided modeling. Overall, these results not only provide practical guidance for building robust predictive models but also offer valuable insights in the field of computational drug discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Here we present a CNN–based scoring function that achieves robust and stable performance through careful attention to training methodology rather than architectural complexity. We systematically evaluate data augmentation strategies and fi nd that random rotation, unlike commonly used 90-degree rotations, eff ectively mitigates rotational variance. We introduce molecular dropout, a simple regularization technique that reduces reliance on isolated protein or ligand features and promotes learning of intermolecular interactions. The resulting model generalizes across diverse test conditions, including time-based and structurally disjoint splits, and performs competitively on standard and external benchmarks. Through systematic ablation studies, error analysis, and interpretability experiments, we provide insights into model behaviour, highlighting the importance of data-centric design in developing reliable scoring functions.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Here we present an approach that combines an expansive dataset of molecular conformers with generative diffusion models to address this problem. We introduce ChEMBL3D, which contains over 250 million molecular geometries for 1.8 million drug-like compounds, optimized using AIMNet2 neural network potentials to a near-quantum mechanical accuracy with implicit solvent effects included. This dataset captures complex organic molecules in various protonation states and stereochemical configurations. We then developed LoQI, a stereochemistry-aware diffusion model that learns molecular geometry distributions directly from this data. Through graph augmentation, LoQI accurately generates molecular structures with targeted stereochemistry, representing a significant advance in modeling capabilities over previous generative methods. The model outperforms traditional approaches, achieving up to tenfold improvements in energy accuracy and effective recovery of optimal conformations. Benchmark tests on complex systems, including macrocycles and flexible molecules, as well as validation with crystal structures, show LoQI can perform low energy conformer search efficiently. The model code and dataset are available at https: //github.com/isayevlab/LoQI.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Existing data acquisition methods are often manual, limited in scope, or require extensive custom software development, impeding progress in leveraging AI for chemical discovery. Here, we introduce ReactionSeek, a framework that synergistically combines large language models (LLMs) with established cheminformatics tools to automate multi-modal data mining from organic synthesis literature. Through sophisticated prompt engineering with minimal custom code, ReactionSeek extracts and standardizes complex textual, graphical, and semantic chemical information. We validated this framework on the entire century-spanning Organic Syntheses collection, achieving over 95% precision and recall for key reaction parameters. This enabled three applications: the generation of a large, AI-ready dataset; an interactive Synthetic Chatbot (SynChat) for natural language querying of chemical data; and an autonomous analysis that revealed decades-long trends in catalysis. ReactionSeek thus provides a universal solution to the data curation bottleneck, paving the way for AI-driven archive mining and knowledge discovery across the chemical sciences.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68932ccb728bf9025e305e90/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

CHIPs combine elemental sulfur with organic comonomers via inverse vulcanization to create a high-sulfur content polymer, with optical properties that rival state-of-the art inorganic solids with the processability and recyclability of plastic materials. However, the optimal comonomer for these applications remains unknown. This manuscript presents a gradient boosted tree model that determines which comonomers merit further consideration as high-performing CHIPs materials. After training models on previously calculated IR-absorption data we apply them to a larger set 960,966 molecules from the GDB dataset and validate the predictions for both highly transparent molecules and a set of one thousand randomly selected molecules. We then look at the 199,511 molecule subset of the expanded search space with chemical moieties eligible for inverse vulcanization and found 2,942 possible comonomers predicted to have better optical properties than the state-of-the-art comonomer Stillene. Finally, we calculate optical properties of all 2,942 comonomers in the gas phase and in a configuration to approximate the polymer films to find a new set of target comonomers.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

However, as AI and LLMs continue to evolve, their ability to accurately and efficiently interpret data from scientific figures and plots remains obscure. In this study, we test and evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in analyzing and extracting information from scientific figures commonly found in materials science literature, including stress-strain curves, heatmaps, 3D plots, contour plots, and other visual representations. We utilize a benchmark dataset comprising figures derived from several published works to evaluate the model's performance in quantitative material property extraction. Preliminary results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LLMs in handling visual scientific content, pointing toward future opportunities for AI-assisted data extraction in materials informatics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Among these, graph-based machine learning (ML) algorithms have garnered significant attention for their ability to capture complex atomic interactions and used them as effective descriptors. In this study, we integrated state-of-the-art generative AI (Gen AI) and ML techniques with quantum mechanical calculations to discover new next-generation electrolytes for alkali metal batteries. We developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework incorporating graph-based generator and discriminator models to generate novel electrolyte candidates. The GAN model was trained on a subset of approximately one million molecules from the GDB-11 database, which enabled the generation of 30,000 unique and chemically valid molecules. Concurrently, a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) model was trained for property prediction by utilizing the QM9 dataset. Using the trained MPNN model, we predicted the properties of the newly generated molecules and screened the candidates based on the criteria of negative standard enthalpy of formation and a wide HOMO-LUMO gap. First-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to undergo additional screening and evaluate key thermodynamic and electrochemical properties, including standard enthalpy of formation, oxidation potential, and reduction potentials. Finally, a set of 26 promising candidates was acquired with outstanding electrochemical characteristics. Our findings demonstrate the potential of AI-driven approaches to discover high-performance, stable, and efficient electrolytes as promising alternatives to conventional organic electrolytes for next-generation energy storage systems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Energy Storage | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information of Generative AI-Driven Discovery of Next-Generation Electrolytes for Alkali Metal Batteries", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689bbda323be8e43d6f780ed/original/supporting-information-of-generative-ai-driven-discovery-of-next-generation-electrolytes-for-alkali-metal-batteries.docx"}]</p></details> |

The workflow includes classical force field (FF) construction of two metallacage analogues and testing for standard and Machine Learning Interatomic Potential (MLIP)-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Overall, the study provides a direct comparison of classical FF with MILPs with respect to performance vs computational cost. The proposed workflow offers a versatile framework for computationally screening and designing supramolecular systems in solution, effectively bridging the gap between quantum-level accuracy and the temporal and spatial scales needed for simulations of different functional applications.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting informatoin", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a436c623be8e43d6e1f5ff/original/supporting-informatoin.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Detailed characterization of these defects remains challenging due to the complexity of the potential energy surface. We efficiently explore the three-fold rotational defect potential energy surface in monolayer MoS2 by combining an evolutionary algorithm with a machine-learning force field. To improve the performance of the structure searches, the algorithm hierarchically restricts the exploration process to a lower-dimensional subspace, utilizing the symmetry operators associated with the investigated defects. We demonstrate that these constrained trajectories exhibit lower global uncertainty measures during the evolution, produce final structures with lower energy distributions and converge faster. Our approach results in the discovery of several novel structures with reasonable computational effort, thereby completing the hierarchy of rotational defects in MoS2.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary material", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a2fd6b23be8e43d6b6f810/original/supplementary-material.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Discovery in Multi-Objective Drug Optimization](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a1e064a94eede1542c01e6/original/amodo-eo-a-practical-framework-for-adaptive-objective-discovery-in-multi-objective-drug-optimization.pdf)** | 2025-08-22 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rjhxn | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective optimization (MOO) in drug discovery typically relies on a fixed set of predefined objectives, such as potency, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility. However, this assumption may overlook emergent molecular trade-offs that arise during the optimization process. This study presents AMODO-EO (Adaptive Multi-Objective Drug Optimization with Emergent Objectives), a computational framework designed to discover and integrate new chemically meaningful objectives during active optimization.
AMODO-EO builds on established principles from symbolic regression and automated feature engineering. It operates by generating candidate objective functions from molecular descriptors using mathematical transformations such as ratios, products, and differences. These candidates are evaluated for statistical independence from existing objectives, sufficient variance across the population, and chemical interpretability. Validated objectives are incorporated into the optimization process using adaptive weighting and conflict resolution mechanisms.
The framework was tested on benchmark datasets and two ChEMBL subsets targeting the dopamine D2 receptor. Initial objectives included binding affinity (pIC₅₀), a drug-likeness composite score, and synthetic accessibility. AMODO-EO consistently identified emergent objectives such as the hydrogen bond acceptor to rotatable bond ratio (HBA/RTB), MW/TPSA ratio, and LogP × aromatic ring count. These objectives passed statistical filters and were chemically interpretable, suggesting they capture relevant trade-offs not encoded in the original objective set.
Optimization performance was evaluated using hypervolume indicators and compared against baseline NSGA-II runs. AMODO-EO maintained competitive performance on original objectives, with a modest reduction in hypervolume (1.5–2.9%), attributed to the computational cost of discovery. Ablation studies confirmed that statistical filtering and interpretability checks are essential for maintaining optimization quality and avoiding spurious objectives.
The inclusion of emergent objectives expanded the Pareto front into higher-dimensional spaces, revealing new solution clusters with distinct chemical profiles. For example, the HBA/RTB ratio highlighted a polarity-flexibility trade-off relevant to ligand design. This objective was consistently discovered across all runs and parameter settings, indicating robustness of the discovery mechanism. Other emergent objectives, such as the Selectivity Score and Synthetic Complexity metric, provided additional design axes that could inform compound prioritization.
Sensitivity analysis showed that AMODO-EO is stable across a range of parameter values, including correlation thresholds, learning rates, and weight-mixing parameters. The framework’s reliance on interpretable descriptor relationships ensures that discovered objectives are scientifically grounded and potentially actionable in medicinal chemistry workflows.
While AMODO-EO currently uses predefined functional forms and semi-automated interpretability checks, future work may incorporate grammar-based symbolic regression and ontology-driven validation to enhance discovery scope and automation. The framework is applicable to various chemical optimization contexts and can be integrated with generative models or molecular simulation pipelines.
In summary, AMODO-EO provides a structured approach to discovering emergent objectives in drug optimization. It extends existing MOO techniques by enabling dynamic expansion of the objective space, offering a more comprehensive view of molecular trade-offs. The framework demonstrates that adaptive objective discovery can be achieved without compromising optimization performance, and that chemically interpretable objectives can be systematically identified from descriptor data.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Source Code", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a1e36b23be8e43d69b85c8/original/source-code.zip"}]</p></details> |

An important target of both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV is the main protease ($M^{pro}$). The ASAP Discovery Consortium focused in the recent years on the acceleration of $M^{pro}$ inhibitors with a part of this initiative being an open blind challenge in collaboration with Valence lab using the Polaris platform, where datasets of previously undisclosed inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 $M^{pro}$ and MERS-CoV $M^{pro}$ was shared with researchers, to allow the development of machine learning and deep learning models for the prediction of the potency. We used this opportunity to evaluate and compare traditional machine learning models consisting of a random forest (RF) and gradient boosting model (XGBoost) with a bayesian neural network (BNN) model. For this purpose, we created single task models for the predictions for each of the targets. The results obtained showed that the BNN model outperformed both traditional machine learning models for both targets, indicating that BNNs are a promising deep learning framework in low-data regimes.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a39c08728bf9025e0d56e3/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This progress highlights the critical need for reliable reference datasets, accurate MLFFs, and, crucially, efficient active learning strategies to enable robust modeling of complex chemical and materials systems. Here, we introduce AIMS-PAX, an automated, multi-trajectory active learning framework that streamlines the development of MLFFs. Designed for both experts and newcomers, AIMS-PAX offers a modular, high-performance workflow that cou- ples flexible sampling with scalable training across CPU and GPU architectures. Built on the widely adopted ab initio code FHI-AIMS, the framework seamlessly integrates with state-of-the-art ML models and supports pretraining using general-purpose (or "foundational") models for rapid deployment in diverse systems. We demonstrate the capabilities of AIMS-PAX on two challenging systems: a highly flexible peptide and bulk CsPbI3 perovskite. Across these cases, AIMS-PAX achieves a reduction of up to two orders of magnitude in the number of required reference calculations and enables over 20x speedup in AL cycle time through optimized resource utilization. This positions AIMS-PAX as a powerful and versatile platform for next-generation ML-driven atomistic simulations in both academic and industrial settings.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Using a dataset of 10,000 organic pi-conjugated molecules calculated at the ZINDO and M06-2X/3-21G* TDDFT computational levels, we trained a model to learn the systematic errors of the low-level method and correct it towards higher-level accuracy values. The best performing model improved the correlation of ZINDO data from 0.75 to 0.95 on a test set of S1 TDDFT target energies, which is consistent with the correlation between TDDFT and experiment. Our model presents a negligible additional computational cost to ZINDO (0.02 ms per molecule), enabling the computational screening of large datasets of molecules using Delta-ML corrected ZINDO calculations.  Critical to the performance of the model is the AttentiveFP Message-Passing Neural Network with added electronic information derived from ZINDO calculations, such as particle-hole densities from the transition density matrix. We also investigate the utility of the Morgan fingerprint and a newly introduced descriptor for the electronic structure of molecules based on the radial distribution function weighted by Molecular Orbital coefficients.

This assumption neglects hemilabile ligands defined by dynamic coordination and highly relevant in catalysis. In this work, we curate datasets of hemilabile and nonhemilabile ligands from experimentally characterized structures in the Cambridge Structural Database, analyze trends in observed coordination modes, and introduce four new exhaustive and mutually exclusive classes of hemilability. Using these labeled datasets, we train graph neural networks to classify hemilabile ligands with high accuracy, precision, and recall and develop an ensemble algorithm which predicts primary and alternative chemically plausible coordination modes from SMILES strings in an end-to-end fashion. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm by generating novel TMCs in predicted coordination modes and calculating the corresponding energy difference due to changes in coordination (i.e., ΔE_c) with density functional theory. Validating our novel TMCs against a ΔE_c benchmark of experimentally observed TMCs reveals strong agreement. We anticipate our open-source workflows will accelerate automated TMC screening by proposing realistic metal–ligand coordination outcomes of synthesized organometallic compounds.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Machine Learning; Ligands (Organomet.); Transition Metal Complexes (Organomet.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary figures and tables", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689f46a1728bf9025e994fd7/original/supplementary-figures-and-tables.pdf"}]</p></details> |

TochANI-Amber incorporates the ANI neural network potentials into the Amber software suite, supporting Amber’s two engines: sander and pmemd. In addition to implementing all published ANI models, the interface is extensible to other energy predicting potentials through a simple mechanism requiring no knowledge of Amber’s codebase. To illustrate this versatility, we implement extensions to the AIMNet2 and Nutmeg potentials. The interface is integrated with Amber’s neighborlists, and it also supports an optimized CUDA implementation for computing the ANI models’ feature vectors, enabling simulations of systems with hundreds of thousands of atoms at the neural network’s level of theory (approaching DFT accuracy). The interface is designed so that all amber capabilities can be used with ANI potentials instead of force fields. To evaluate the energy conservation, stability, and performance of the ANI potentials as used through the interface, we run MD simulations on different biomolecular systems, including ubiquitin and Trp-cage proteins in explicit solvent. Additionally, we demon- strate the use of these potentials in the context of enhanced sampling techniques, such as temperature replica-exchange molecular dynamics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplemental Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689f6655a94eede154eb0a5e/original/supplemental-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The ring-opening dynamics, which involves three lowest singlet electronic states, were investigated using Landau-Zener-based surface hopping dynamics with MLPs. The training datasets were generated from QM-based surface hopping simulations at the SA-3-CASSCF/cc-pVDZ level of theory. Our results show that MS-ANI significantly outperforms SS-ANI in modelling multiple electronic states, yielding more accurate energy predictions, stable energy gaps, and reliable population dynamics. MS-ANI effectively captures interstate correlations, ensuring consistent energy profiles and correct state crossings, making it robust for non-adiabatic molecular dynamics. In contrast, SS-ANI exhibited unstable energy gap behaviors producing negative gaps between the adiabatic potential energy surfaces and inadequate population behavior during the dynamics. Dataset quality and diversity were also found critical, with MS-ANI benefiting most from larger, well-curated datasets. These findings establish MS-ANI as a powerful, scalable approach for sufficiently accurate excited-state simulations in complex photochemical systems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689f5b3ea94eede154ea027b/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This study focuses on predict- ing key pharmacokinetic endpoints related to Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME), leveraging extensive internal and newly available public hiqh- quality ADME data. We assess data-integration strategies for ADME prediction across six endpoints using single-source (internal or public), pooled single-task, and multi-task learning models. Models trained on combined data — especially multi-task models — generally outperform single-source baselines, with consistent gains on public tests and frequent gains on internal tests when public data complement and are proportionally balanced with in-house data size. Applicability domain analyses show that multi-task learning reduces error for compounds with higher similarity to the training space, indicating better generalization across combined spaces. Analysis of prediction uncer- tainties mirrors these observations. Our study underscores that curated integration of high-quality public datasets with proprietary data can deliver more accurate and better-calibrated in silico ADME models to support computational compound design in drug discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplements", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689ef1ce728bf9025e911741/original/supplements.pdf"}]</p></details> |

We introduce the Molecular Equivariant Transformer (MET), a symmetry-aware pretraining framework that leverages quantum-derived atomic charge distributions to guide molecular representation learning. MET combines an Equivariant Graph Neural Network (EGNN) with a Transformer architecture to extract physically meaningful features from three-dimensional molecular geometries. Unlike previous models that rely purely on structural inputs or handcrafted descriptors, MET is pretrained to predict atomic partial charges, which are quantities grounded in quantum chemistry. This enables MET to capture essential electronic information without requiring downstream labels. We show that this pretraining scheme improves performance across diverse molecular property prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. Analyses of the learned representations reveal chemically interpretable structure–property relationships, including the emergence of functional group patterns and smooth alignment with molecular dipoles. Ablation studies confirm that the EGNN encoder plays a crucial role in capturing transferable spatial features, while the Transformer layers adapt these features to specific prediction tasks. This architecture draws direct analogies to quantum mechanical basis transformations, where MET learns to transition from coordinate-based to electron-based representations in a symmetry-preserving manner. By integrating domain knowledge with modern deep learning techniques, MET offers a unified and interpretable framework for data-efficient molecular modeling, with broad applications in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Here, we introduce a scalable defect-engineering route that creates subsurface chalcogen vacancies—selectively generated in the bottom chalcogen layer by tunable electron irradiation—yielding chemically clean, stable, and interface-protected active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) and statistical thermodynamics calculations reveal adsorption, charge transfer, and carrier modulation in MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 for key air pollutants over 0.01–1000 ppm at 300 K The impact of these buried vacancies is found to be highly material- and analyte- dependent: for N2, O2, CH4, NH3, H2S, and CO2, vacancy effects are negligible across all substrates, whereas for SO2 and NO2 the enhancements are substantial and strongly TMD-specific. At only 2% vacancy density, MoS2 and MoSe2 exhibit modest (<15%) carrier modulation gains, while MoTe2 shows exceptional improvements—exceeding 50% for SO2 and reaching up to 350% for NO2 in the sub-ppm regime—driven by markedly increased adsorption coverage at defect sites. These results position subsurface vacancy engineering as a targeted and scalable route to selective, high-sensitivity TMD gas sensors, identifying MoTe2 as a particularly compelling platform for ultra-trace detection.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Sensors; Solid State Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

This approach paves the way toward a new class of approximations within Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT). However, since all existing Quantum Theory Project (QTP) functionals are derived from CAM-B3LYP, we pose the question: Can COT improve the hybrid versions of different exchange-correlation (XC) functionals as well? To that end, we explore two optimization strategies for adjusting the existing parameters within PBE0, TPSS0, and LC-PBE0: \textit{i}) the ionization potential (IP) condition and \textit{ii}) the HOMO–LUMO condition. As a result, in general, enforcing the IP condition consistently improves performance across the functionals from the PBE family.

Existing approaches often suffer from arbitrariness in reference selection, limited applicability, or high computational cost. In particular, the balance of π-energy between the target molecule and its strain-free references has long been overlooked, which is critical for π-conjugated systems. Here, we introduce “autodesmotic reactions” as a general and efficient strategy for reliable SE evaluation in polycyclic aromatic nanocarbons. An autodesmotic reaction transforms a strained molecule into a uniquely defined single-molecule reference. This reference resides within a virtual strain-free chemical space derived from physically motivated models trained on planar benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Crucially, preservation of molecular topology ensures both unique reference choice and proper π-energy balance. Benchmarking against asymptotic and StrainViz models across diverse carbon nanobelts (CNBs) validates the accuracy and robustness of the approach. It is broadly applicable to both macrocyclic and nonmacrocyclic systems while requiring only a single quantum chemical calculation per molecule. Applications to more challenging systems, including helicene-containing and saddle-shaped CNBs, helicenes, bowl-shaped PAHs, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes, demonstrate high computational efficiency and provide valuable insights into strain–structure–property relationships. Overall, autodesmotic reactions establish a general, conceptually transparent, and efficient framework for SE analysis in π-conjugated nanocarbons. The accuracy and generalizability of the current method can be further enhanced through rapidly advancing machine-learning techniques. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Technical Details (PDF)", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a3323e728bf9025eff459a/original/technical-details-pdf.pdf"}, {"title": "Atomic Coordinates (ZIP)", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a332b7728bf9025eff51ae/original/atomic-coordinates-zip.zip"}]</p></details> |

However, 2DES experiments are generally difficult to interpret, often relying on simulations in order to associate observed spectral features with specific underlying system dynamics. For this reason, the development of robust, computationally inexpensive theoretical methods for modeling these experiments remains an active area of research. We have recently derived such an approach for computing the exact finite-temperature nonlinear response function for harmonic Hamiltonians within the Condon approximation, assuming that the transition dipole moment is independent of nuclear coordinates. In this work, we extend our formalism to exactly account for non-Condon/Herzberg-Teller (HT) type contributions to the nonlinear response function, which are known to be crucial for accurately describing linear optical spectra in a wide range of molecular systems. We highlight the key insights that can be gained from our new method, named FC2DES+HT, by simulating the 2DES signals of two molecules with known non-Condon behavior, the phenolate anion and free-base porphyrin. The results demonstrate that Herzberg-Teller couplings substantially impact energy relaxation dynamics in these systems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Quantum Mechanics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "SI for: FC2DES+HT: Including Herzberg-Teller effects in the simulation of 2D electronic spectra for harmonic Hamiltonians", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689fd1cca94eede154f9b7b6/original/si-for-fc2des-ht-including-herzberg-teller-effects-in-the-simulation-of-2d-electronic-spectra-for-harmonic-hamiltonians.pdf"}]</p></details> |

thereby capturing complex group-level relationships. Superhypergraphs advance this framework by introducing
recursively nested powerset layers, enabling the representation of hierarchical and self-referential connections
among hyperedges. A line graph encodes the adjacencies between edges of an original graph by transforming
each edge into a vertex and connecting two vertices if their corresponding edges share a common endpoint.
An iterated line graph arises from the repeated application of the line graph construction, where each iteration
takes the previous line graph as its input.
In the field of chemistry, concepts such as molecular graphs and chemical graphs are well established, and
the theories of hypergraphs, line graphs, and superhypergraphs have also been investigated within this context.

However, due to their high structural flexibility compared to conventional protein targets, it is critical to gain detailed mechanistic insights into beyond-millisecond timescale RNA conformational transitions coupled to ligand binding for the rational design of RNA-targeted drugs. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been a powerful tool for studying the atomistic details of ligand-binding mechanisms but their timescales are limited to a few microseconds (μs). Enhanced sampling methods can overcome this challenge by applying a biasing force to overcome high free energy barriers. In this work, we performed different variants of the On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) algorithm in the presence of a funnel-like restraint to compute the underlying free energy landscape and kinetics of ligand binding to the theophylline RNA aptamer. Our simulations capture the coupling between the cytosine-27 (C27) nucleotide flipping transition and the ligand binding coordinate. We could reproduce the relative trends of the binding affinities and the residence times for three different ligands to the RNA aptamer using the multiple walker OPES and the OPES-flooding algorithms, respectively. Our simulations sample two distinct binding mechanisms, conformational selection and induced fit, and demonstrate that the preference for the mechanism can be determined by the binding affinity. Combining such mechanistic insights with the free energy and kinetics obtained from the enhanced sampling simulations can provide a molecular-level understanding of the chemistry and biology of RNA-ligand recognition. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Biophysical Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689d84ce23be8e43d6211955/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

For systems exhibiting strong electron correlation, multireference methods are essential to reliably describe molecular properties such as dipole moments. We derive and implement analytic expressions for permanent dipole moments of ground and excited states for linearized pair-density functional theory (L- PDFT), starting with state-averaged complete active space wave functions as reference functions. Dipole moments are evaluated via response theory as the first derivative of the L-PDFT energy with respect to an external electric field. We evaluated the performance of L-PDFT for acetylene, phenol, the spiro cation, and benchmarks of 20 aromatic molecules. L-PDFT consistently predicts accurate dipole moments near conical intersections and in regions of strong nuclear-electronic coupling. The ability to produce smooth and accurate dipole surfaces for diverse molecular systems establishes L-PDFT as a promising method for spectroscopic analysis and generating machine- learning potentials.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Analytic Dipole Moments For Complete Active Space Linearized Pair Density Functional Theory", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689d0586a94eede1549ed233/original/supporting-information-analytic-dipole-moments-for-complete-active-space-linearized-pair-density-functional-theory.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here, we introduce the data-driven CASPT2 (DDCASPT2) method to capture dynamical electron correlation using features generated from lower-level electronic structure methods such as Hartree-Fock and complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) theory. We examine the effects of system size, basis set size, and number of two-electron excitations using a small, but diverse, set of molecules. We also provide insights into our physics-based feature set using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis, a feature analysis method based on cooperative game theory. In this paper, we utilize these insights to introduce a DDCASPT2 method, which provides a machine learning-based alternative to traditional single- and multi-state CASPT2 for capturing dynamical electron correlation with near-CASPT2 quality accuracy.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |
