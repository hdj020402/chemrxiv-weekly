Despite these advantages, their rational design and optimization remain challenging due to the dynamic nature of their interfacial binding sites and complex structure-activity relationships. Computational methods for binding affinity prediction are crucial for accelerating drug discovery, with Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) being a gold standard for accuracy at high computational cost, and co-folding models like Boltz-2 offering speed but with unproven accuracy on novel targets. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of FEP and Boltz-2 for predicting the binding affinity of molecular glues to protein complexes. We assessed 93 compounds across six diverse target/effector complexes, yielding 140 unique protein-compound measurements with experimentally validated ternary complex binding and degradation data. Our results demonstrate that FEP consistently outperforms Boltz-2 across all datasets in terms of correlation and RMSE, showing good absolute predictability with RMSE values within 0.3-1.25 kcal/mol as well as strong correlations. In contrast, Boltz-2 exhibited poor absolute predictability (RMSE over 3 kcal/mol in some cases) and generally poor or even negative correlations. While FEP is computationally more expensive, its accuracy makes it a valuable tool for molecular glue optimization. The poor performance of Boltz-2 suggests it is not suitable for high-throughput screening of molecular glues, highlighting the need for more accurate, high-throughput machine learning methods for pre-FEP screening. This work underscores the current capabilities and limitations of computational methods in the challenging field of molecular glue discovery. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68bad7d8a94eede154e0dd40/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

In this work, we present LoRA-Chem, an innovative modular framework that demonstrates remarkable performance in predicting individual organic reactions while achieving unprecedented multitask capacity. This unified architecture enables accurate forecasting of diverse reaction types through a single integrated model - a critical advancement that addresses longstanding limitations in traditional prediction methodologies. Importantly, our investigation reveals that strategic improvements in the foundational model architecture can substantially enhance the system's predictive accuracy. The demonstrated versatility and scalability of the LoRA-Chem framework suggest transformative potential for next-generation reaction prediction systems, offering a robust platform for developing sophisticated artificial intelligence solutions in synthetic chemistry.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

While machine learning tools are broadly used, algorithms that automate reasoning are far less common. We elaborate on seven categories of human reasoning activities and connect each to applications in chemical science and engineering: inductive, deductive, abductive, probabilistic, causal, analogical, and informal reasoning. For each, we describe approaches and tools for implementing in computational settings. We find the traditional categories of logic (induction, deduction, abduction) to be useful for interpreting a wide range of research activities in the computational sciences: curve fitting and supervised learning are induction, predicting from a curve or a supervised model is deduction, first-principles simulations are deduction, molecular structure elucidation is abduction, and inverse design is isomorphic to abduction. Experimental design incorporates themes of all three, but also stands apart because it modifies the data. We also survey the ``reasoning'' capabilities of large language models, and illustrate some challenges and opportunities in building systems that learn to reason. Central concepts that emerge include the dual nature of reasoning as propositional and step-by-step (the "what" and the "how"), the importance of appreciating syntax and semantics, and the centrality of abstraction in formal and informal contexts. Throughout, we highlight untapped opportunities, including bug-free scientific computing software, predictive modeling approaches to generalize outside training data, inverse design, and automated hypothesis generation and evaluation. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Chemical Education; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Parameter-efficient finetuning techniques are critical to democratize AI-driven drug discovery and design. 

In this paper, we integrate Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) with chemical language models, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters required for finetuning. We observe improved performance of 3-5% for AUC metric across classification tasks, for molecule toxicity, blood- brain barrier permeability, and flavor prediction tasks over state-of-the-art like Molformer-XL and MAMMAL. We attain optimal performance by comprehensive benchmarking of embeddings generated from zero-shot and finetuned CLMs combined with molecular physicochemical properties across three diverse datasets. Our approach achieves MCC scores ranging from 0.80 to 0.90 across three tasks, while reducing model parameters by 62% to 96% in the top-performing models. This is achieved via lightweight adaptation of CLMs, which retains their performance efficiency while reducing the over-parameterization burden. This work provides a practical framework for deploying a scalable and sustainable paradigm for high-performance molecular AI tools in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Chemoinformatics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68b7f51523be8e43d6a7cd37/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

To address this growing demand, we developed autoXAS: a python package for easy, fast, and reproducible processing and analysis of in-situ and operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) data. The package features a wide range of interactive plots for data exploration and in-depth analysis of results directly in a Jupyter notebook. autoXAS also offers options for exporting data and analysis results to csv format for easy integration with other programs. In this paper, the features of autoXAS are summarized and exemplified using experimental in situ XAS data of the formation of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles. The autoXAS package can be installed using pip, and the code is open-sourced on GitHub, where we encourage the XAS community to contribute to further development.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

The inherent tendency of MXenes to degrade under environmental conditions constrains their compositional diversity and limits certain practical applications. Our computational study shows that degradation of defect-free Ti3C2Tx is kinetically limited, whereas common defects markedly lower the activation barriers for water attack.. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with thermodynamic analysis, we show that VTi defects act as active sites for protonation of subsurface carbon atoms, weakening the bonds with and accelerating release of adjacent Ti atoms. Targeted passivation of these sites by adsorbed metal cations (e.g., Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+) is predicted to effectively mitigate degradation by suppressing protonation and increasing the barrier for Ti oxidation. This stabilization arises from two synergistic effects: (i) electronic structure modification driven by a strong dipole moment, which markedly shifts the work function, and (ii) steric hindrance that limits water access to reactive defect sites. We also find that VC defects significantly destabilize adjacent Ti atoms, lowering the energy barrier for water attack reaction. The substitution of VC with electronegative species such as O or N does not significantly improve stability of Ti3C2Tx, highlighting the detrimental role of any defects in carbon sublattice. Because VC are typically inherited from the precursor MAX phase and cannot be removed during post-synthesis, controlling their concentration during MAX phases synthesis is essential. Our thermodynamic analysis reveals that Al-rich conditions substantially raise the formation energy of VC defects in a large spectrum of MAX phases, providing a generalizable strategy for defect suppression and enhanced MXene durability. Our thermodynamic analysis reveals that A-rich (e.g., Al-rich) synthesis conditions substantially raise the formation energy of VC and VN defects in a large spectrum of Mn+1AXn phases, providing a generalizable strategy for defect suppression and improved durability of resulting MXenes. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Machine Learning; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study; Interfaces; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Machine Learning for Retention Time Prediction
in Supercritical Fluid Chromatography](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68be94bba94eede15450c2af/original/automated-synthesis-and-fragment-descriptor-based-machine-learning-for-retention-time-prediction-in-supercritical-fluid-chromatography.pdf)** | 2025-09-12 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-s2qhv | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of automated synthesis and machine learning (ML) is transforming analytical
chemistry by enabling data-driven approaches to method development. Chromatographic column
selection, a critical yet time-consuming step in separation science, stands to benefit substantially
from such advances. Here, we report a workflow that combines automated synthesis of a
structurally diverse amide library with fragment descriptor–based ML for retention time
prediction in supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Retention data were systematically
acquired on the recently developed DCpak® PBT column, providing one of the first structured
datasets for this stationary phase. Benchmarking revealed that fragment-count descriptors
(ChyLine and CircuS) substantially outperformed conventional molecular fingerprints, delivering
higher predictive accuracy and more interpretable relationships between substructures and
retention behavior. External validation underscored the role of chemical space coverage, while
visualization techniques such as ColorAtom analysis offered mechanistic insight into model
decisions. By uniting automated synthesis with chemoinformatics-driven ML, this study
demonstrates a scalable approach to generating high-quality training data and predictive models
for chromatography. Beyond retention prediction, the framework exemplifies how data-centric
strategies can accelerate column characterization, reduce reliance on trial-and-error
experimentation, and advance the development of autonomous, high-throughput analytical
workflows.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Chemoinformatics; Separation Science; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Experimental and computational data", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68be97eaa94eede15451231c/original/experimental-and-computational-data.pdf"}]</p></details> |

MAMD propagates coordinate trajectories in time without access to forces or energies during training or inference. Applied to isolated harmonic diatomics, MAMD conserves total energy, preserves molecular structure, and reproduces velocity autocorrelation functions. Small integration errors can accumulate over long trajectories, but we show that molecular dynamics stability can be recovered through periodic, but infrequent injections of velocity updates computed from Hamiltonian forces (frequency ≤ 0.01). We also find that the optimal history length for each diatom closely matches the first inflection point of its velocity autocorrelation function, suggesting a link between model architecture and statistical mechanics. These results demonstrate the feasibility of MAMD as a proof-of-concept integration strategy, in which finite velocity memory supports short-horizon predictions and sparse Hamiltonian check-ins provide long-horizon stability. Specifically, we show that force-free, velocity-based machine learning updates can be embedded directly into conventional molecular dynamics algorithms while retaining essential physical invariants, providing a physically interpretable basis for hybrid MD/ML integration.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Velocity Updates from Machine Learning for Stable Molecular Dynamics Integration", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68be48f4728bf9025efc2e26/original/supporting-information-velocity-updates-from-machine-learning-for-stable-molecular-dynamics-integration.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Learning Approach to Locate the Transition
Point of a Mixture of Deep Eutectic Solvent
and Water](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68b81fdf728bf9025efdaae8/original/a-molecular-dynamics-assisted-machine-learning-approach-to-locate-the-transition-point-of-a-mixture-of-deep-eutectic-solvent-and-water.pdf)** | 2025-09-11 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-wvqlp | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep eutectic solvents (DES) are highly viscous, which hinders their applications in different areas. Their viscosities can be reduced by adding a small amount of water. However, when an excessive amount of water is added, the DES loses its inherent structure and becomes an aqueous solution of DES components. The concentration at which the transition from “water in DES” to “DES in water” occurs can be defined as the transition point of that particular DES. When the mixture of DES and water is used for any application, it is very important that the original supramolecular structure is retained. Hence, it will be beneficial to have the value of the transition point. We have proposed a method for finding the transition point with the help of classical molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning. Various structural and dynamical properties of DES-water mixtures at different mole fractions of water are calculated and fitted using machine learning methods to locate the transition point. The lowest transition point obtained from all of the properties can be treated as the lower limit for the water-rich phase.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information ", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68b8236e728bf9025efe8354/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, their computation via DFT is time-consuming, limiting high-throughput screening. This work presents a machine learning (ML) methodology based on graph representations of local adsorption sites, using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with per-atom local descriptors derived from accessible physicochemical properties. The approach is evaluated on two bimetallic datasets. The first includes AB-type bimetallic flat surfaces with varying A:B ratios, predicting binding energies for small monodentate adsorbates (C, N, O, S, H) with MSEs of 0.073/0.181 eV (train/test). The second dataset comprises reaction energies of key intermediates for CO2 hydrogenation on Ni-Ga-based surfaces. The GNN model achieves an impressive performance (MSE: 0.001/0.002 (train/test) eV) on complex atomic configurations, even bidentate ones. Beyond predictive performance, clustering analysis provides an explainable framework, showing how structural and electronic descriptors can rationally guide catalyst design and deepen understanding of adsorbate-metal interactions.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Explainable GNN Framework Guided by Local Chemical Features to Predict Binding Energies in Bimetallic Alloys", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68bf36d023be8e43d6c8c524/original/explainable-gnn-framework-guided-by-local-chemical-features-to-predict-binding-energies-in-bimetallic-alloys.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method, based on microscopic molecular collisions, is a key approach to tackle this challenge. By generating state-to-state (StS) integral cross sections (ICSs), QCT simulations enable detailed modeling of high-temperature thermochemical
non-equilibrium flows. However, existing dynamic programs do not have an automated workflow that converts trajectory data into reaction rate coefficients. This work introduces a modular QCT Workflow for Dynamics and Kinetics of atom-diatom (A + BC) collisions built upon the VENUS program,
WDK-VENUS. The VENUS program is amended to enable handling high rovibrational initial conditions. An automated and efficient bmax test module is introduced. Additionally, an external Python code is provided with four modules: sampling, Gaussian process regression (GPR), model
validation, and equilibrium/non-equilibrium rate coefficient calculation. The main function of this workflow is to use GPR machine learning methods to fit models, export large amounts of high-precision ICSs, and calculate equilibrium/non-equilibrium rate coefficients with less human intervention. The modular design of WDK-VENUS simplifies QCT calculations, supports batch processing, and integrates Python analysis tools. This workflow is expected
to facilitate broader applications in interdisciplinary fields.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemical Kinetics | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Here, we demonstrate how contributions from system-specific electronic structure machine learning (ESML) models may be combined (“stitched”) to deliver density matrices of entire systems of interest, improving the initial guess for the self-consistent field cycle and delivering gains in computational efficiency. The “stitching” of density matrices is demonstrated for sequential calculations, such as geometry optimization and molecular dynamics, and we show that the synergistic use of ESML models and density matrix extrapolation algorithms can accelerate standard computational calculations. The algorithms are demonstrated for test cases relating to water clusters and a methane clathrate cage, with the benefits discussed. The future opportunities for hybrid quantum mechanical and ML (QM/ML), and also ML/ML paradigms, are broad-ranging with significant computational speed-up attainable.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

A fundamental challenge lies in the inherent biases of public biochemical databases. These databases predominantly catalog valid enzyme activities, rarely include negative instances, and report quantitative catalytic parameters for only a relatively small subset of enzymes. Such limitations pose a major obstacle to supervised learning of enzyme catalytic properties. One existing approach for model training involves generating synthetic negative enzyme--activity pairs by recombining existing enzymes and their activity information, particularly substrates or chemical reactions, that were not originally associated within datasets. However, it remains unclear whether generated negative examples are truly inactive or merely unobserved active instances. To build a model that captures functional properties across diverse enzyme families while avoiding reliance on negative examples, this paper introduces a self-supervised domain adaptation methodology for pretrained protein language models solely on positive enzyme-reaction pairs. The enzyme representations obtained from the adapted protein language model achieved superior or at least competitive performance in comparison with those from an existing method that rely on synthetic negative examples, in both the turnover number prediction task for natural reactions of wild-type enzymes and activity prediction task for family-wide enzyme-substrate specificity screening datasets. Overall, our approach establishes a foundation for future studies to leverage the growing volume of enzyme activity data in biochemical databases.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information ", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68b9a5cda94eede1549de937/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

In this work, we evaluate the ability of neural network potentials (NNPs) trained on OMol25 to predict experimental reduction-potential and electron-affinity values for a variety of main-group and organometallic species, and compare these NNPs to low-cost density-functional theory (DFT) and semiempirical-quantum-mechanical (SQM) methods. Surprisingly, we find that the tested OMol25-trained NNPs are as accurate or more accurate than low-cost DFT and SQM methods despite not considering explicit physics.  Additionally, the tested OMol25-trained NNPs tend to predict the charge-related properties of organometallic species more accurately than the charge-related properties of main-group species, contrary to the trend for DFT and SQM methods.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Quantum computers are anticipated to overcome these challenges by providing more accurate simulations of complex quantum systems. However, the current generation of quantum devices is limited by noise and deco- herence, restricting their practical applications. To overcome these limitations, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigen- solver (VQE) have been developed.

We investigate the origin of this dichotomy by simulations based on quantum–quantum–classical em- bedded GW–Bethe–Salpeter equation of conversion dynamics from localized to charge- transfer (CT) excitations at the interface of a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) polymer and fullerene. Specifically, we determine the excitonic energy levels, their electronic couplings, and the reorganization energies for the respective conversion processes within Marcus theory. Our calculations yield a variety of CT-type excitations of different characters with the lowest integer CT excitations of relevance for charge generation separated by 0.30 eV. Further analysis reveals that the activation barrier for conver- sion to the lowest CT state is significantly higher (0.25 eV) for the polymer LE than for the fullerene LE (0.05 eV), leading to a preferred population of the higher, less strongly bound CT state from the photoexcited donor. From a population dynamics model we find that, indeed, on the time scale of one picosecond after the respective excitation, the donor excitation leads to the formation of a CT excitation with on average 0.16-0.27 eV lower electron-hole binding energy, providing a pathway to faster charge separation.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

In this study, we employ multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to examine the relaxation characteristics of model polyisoprene(PI) melts through the transition from the Rouse regime to entangled systems. We probed the impact of molecular weight and stereochemistry, and we evaluated the accuracy of theory in modeling the end-to-end relaxation. Our results support that trans-PI dynamics is distinct, with entanglements forming at a lower degree of polymerization than other compositions due to differences in the characteristic ratio and packing of this polymer. For all moderately entangled systems, modeling the end- to-end relaxation with the original Likhtman-McLeish theory with contour-length fluctuations presents deviations from recorded data both in the early-time and terminal regime. We propose numerical modifications that significantly improve the model for all systems studied without introducing additional parameters. Our approach allows accurate predictions for long macromolecules based on data from detailed simulations with moderately entangled polyisoprene systems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Polymer Science; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Polymer chains; Theory - Computational; Transport Phenomena (Chem.

Surface hopping dynamics, utilizing time-dependent density functional theory, elucidates the relaxation pathways of the three constitutional isomers in both gas-phase and solvent environments. Particular attention is given to intersystem crossing (ISC) and internal conversion in the triplet manifold, as the lowest triplet state is known to play a critical role in driving the excited-state proton transfer process in the ortho-isomer. The efficiency of ISC was analyzed by evaluating electronic features and energy gaps derived from molecular dynamics simulations.

Electronic correlation and environmental polarization are key factors influencing negative ΔEST , and the latter is gaining attention for its possible role in “mimicking” correlation contributions to yield negative ΔEST . However, a comprehensive study of solvation effects on both structures and energy gaps is still lacking. In this work, we evaluate computational strategies for calculating ΔEST < 0 gaps, incorporating electronic correlation and solvent polarization in molecules exhibiting singlet-triplet inversion. Using RMS–CASPT2 as a benchmark, we demonstrate that double-hybrid density functionals and mixed-reference spin-flip TD-DFT (MRSF– TD-DFT) can partially recover electronic correlation. Furthermore, we investigate solvation effects on both singlet and triplet excited states, highlighting the limitations of linear-response schemes in continuum solvation models. We finally develop a protocol combining electronic correlation and state-specific solvent polarization using double-hybrid functionals and the Vertical Excitation Model (VEM), leveraging its Lagrangian implementation to compute structures and adiabatic energies. Applying our B2PLYP/VEM(UD) protocol to larger systems with experimentally observed negative ΔEST gaps, we quantitatively reproduce experimental emissive and non-radiative transition rates.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68bafec8728bf9025e9b75ee/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, their description with approximate electronic structure models is a long standing challenge due to the manybody correlation effects, relatively small energy scales, and potentially large system sizes involved. In this work we first assess the simplest phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) model, which uses restricted Hartree-Fock trial wavefunctions, for representative test sets of noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, and dispersion (S66, A24, S22, and X31). Against CCSD(T) reference values, we find accuracy consistently better than CCSD, and sometimes dramatically better than MP2. In addition, we use the water dimer (with available CCSDTQ reference energies) to demonstrate that noncovalent interaction energies calculated with ph-AFQMC-RHF benefit significantly from error cancellation. In this spirit, we further show how a branching correlated sampling scheme can be used to reduce the computational cost of noncovalent interaction energy calculations, paving the way to more tractable ph-AFQMC studies of larger molecules.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Noncovalent interaction energies with phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68b765b523be8e43d695bcfa/original/supporting-information-noncovalent-interaction-energies-with-phaseless-auxiliary-field-quantum-monte-carlo.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The ability to distinguish between specific PET channels and compare their timescales with competing photophysical events is also essential for the design synthetic light harvesting systems. However, commonly used statistical rate theories often break down owing to strong electronic coupling and the nonequilibrium nature of PET. Experimental tracking of particular photophysical processes with time-resolved techniques also remains a notorious challenge. Here, we employed surface-hopping nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics simulations and statistical rate theories to characterize ultrafast PET in a dimer of stacked adenine nucleobases. We show that the widely used classical Marcus Theory and Fermi's Golden Rule fail to describe ultrafast PET or even reproduce qualitative rate trends. Instead, we propose a chromophore-localized variant of nonadiabatic Rice-Rampsperger-Kassel-Marcus (NA-RRKM) theory, which yields PET timescales that are in excellent agreement with excited-state dynamics simulations. We argue that by accounting for the nonequilibrium nature of PET, the NA-RRKM approach offers strong predictive capacity for the design of efficient photoredox-active chromophores.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Chemical Kinetics; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Electronic Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68aaf003a94eede15456e340/original/electronic-supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here, first-principles excited-state dynamics was combined with kinetic modelling to dissect the photochemistry of the plant anthraquinone rubiadin. Ground- and excited-state calculations reveal that the neutral species undergoes barrierless excited state intramolecular proton transfer that channels population into a long-lived triplet reservoir with high ΦT, whereas the monoanion relaxes almost exclusively by internal conversion, quenching phototoxicity. Two-photon cross-sections are intrinsically small, consistent with the asymmetric substitution pattern. Triplet–triplet Dexter transfer to O₂ is exergonic and efficient, while radical-mediated type I/III pathways are hindered by large reorganization energies. These photophysical insights underlie the pH-dependent ΦΔ, with a sharp inflection near the H₂Rbd/HRbd⁻ crossover. Parameterized ordinary differential equation models further quantify how photosensitizer loading, initial oxygen concentration, and oxygen resupply rates control the competition between productive Dexter transfer and nonproductive decay pathways, predicting steep losses in ¹O₂ yield under hypoxic conditions. Collectively, this work highlights the interplay of molecular speciation, triplet dynamics, and oxygen kinetics in governing PDT efficiency and informs strategies for mitigating hypoxia-limited phototoxicity.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Chemical Kinetics; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Materials", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68b9596ba94eede15481db68/original/supporting-materials.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The nature of the first excited singlet state (S1) in these molecules remains under debate, with authors presenting conflicting claims. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by demonstrating that S1 possesses charge transfer (CT) character. In solution, UV/vis absorption spectra show a strong transition below 375 nm, indicative of a locally excited (LE) state, while the CT (S1) transition remains optically quasi-dark due to its low oscillator strength. Direct excitation into S1 is inefficient; however, S1 becomes emissive following population from the higher-lying S2 (LE) state. By contrast, in the solid state, a pronounced absorption band appears beyond 400 nm is present, concurrent with a single emission band. Solution-phase dual emission is contrasted by the solid state’s single emission. Time-resolved measurements reveal complex emission dynamics, including nanosecond prompt fluorescence and microsecond delayed fluorescence via TADF and triplet-triplet annihilation. Ultrafast spectroscopy (35-fs pump) uncovers coherent oscillations, attributing these to vibronic coupling between S2 (LE) and S1 (CT) states. The transition dipole moment analysis for vibronically coupled states indicates that S1 and S2 possess opposing dipole orientations, causing destructive interference and “quasi-dark” S1 absorption in solution; this cancellation is suppressed in the solid, enabling bright CT absorption. These insights clarify the excited-state dynamics of NI derivatives and expand their applicability in next-generation OLEDs with tailored TADF properties</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Theory - Computational; Quantum Mechanics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplimentary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68b93aefa94eede1547b18c3/original/supplimentary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here, we introduce a unified theoretical framework that rigorously incorporates vibronic contributions through a phase-consistent Herzberg-Teller expansion of the hyperfine Hamiltonian. Applying this method to the FMNH•-Cys• radical pair in AsLOV2, we demonstrate that second-order vibronic coupling significantly enhances the effective rates of hyperfine-mediated electronic transitions between spin states by up to eight orders of magnitude. Rates increase from∼ 10^0 s−1 in the Franck-Condon limit to∼ 10^8 s−1 on the singlet manifold and∼ 10^7 s−1 on the triplet manifold. This brings the kinetics into the nanosecond regime, which is essential for enabling the microsecond-timescale photoadduct formation central to their biological function. Our analysis across Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt spectral profiles further reveals the critical sensitivity of these kinetics to environmental broadening, with the Voigt profile providing the most physically realistic rates. This work underscores the importance of incorporating a vibronic description in hyperfine-driven dynamics, and provides a generalised and transferable methodology framework for studying spin-dependent photophysics important in biological systems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68b7db1923be8e43d6a3d97b/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

In contrast, this work considers an improved description of spin-orbit coupling by explicitly accounting for its relativistic origins. To this end, we extend the standard one-electron triatomic Jahn–Teller model to the four-component relativistic domain. In our formulation, the electron is treated using the Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian, while the nuclei remain non-relativistic, departing from the conventional for- mulation that incorporates the Pauli–Breit spin-orbit coupling as a perturbation. The most striking difference between our relativistic model and the conventional one is the presence of vibronic coupling terms on the anti-diagonal of the diabatic potential matrix. These terms scale as 1/c2, and although nominally small, they can be amplified near avoided- crossings or in systems with heavy nuclei. The presence of these couplings implies that nuclear motion can affect the direction of the electron spin, a feature entirely absent in the conventional formulation. In the adiabatic representation, these additional couplings trans- late to non-Abelian characteristics of the non-adiabatic coupling matrix that persist even in the single-surface limit. Thus, our relativistic formulation reveals a more intricate interplay between the electronic spin and nuclear degrees of freedom. These model findings suggest that more spin-dependent effects may yet be uncovered through improved treatments of spin-orbit coupling.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

It had been shown in experimental studies that the ground spin state of these complexes influences the photochemical reaction pathways. Low-spin complexes 1 and 2 exhibit wavelength-dependent competition between photoreductive and redox-neutral ligand dissociation, and photooxidation to yield high-valent nitrenoid species. More specifically, excitation of 1 and 2 with visible light promotes photoreductive and redox-neutral ligand dissociation pathways, whereas excitation with UV light allows accessing the photooxidation channel via excited states that effectively funnel energy into azide-centered low-frequency vibrational modes. In contrast, the high-spin ground state of 3 with a significantly altered excited state manifold precludes photooxidation, instead favoring photoreduction and a unique acetato-ligand decarboxylation channel not observed in the low-spin analogs. In this first comparative in silico study of the three complexes, we show how the steric demands of the methylated ligand in 3 lead to a weakened equatorial ligand field resulting in a high spin ground state which in turn influences the excited state manifold. With a simple approach wherein we explore the evolution of the electronically excited states along specific vibrational modes, we find the onset of dissociative photooxidation paths in 1 and 2 which are absent in the high-spin species 3. Similarly, we can rationalise why photoinduced decarboxylation is only observed in 3. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Transition Metal Complexes (Inorg.); Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information for \"Ligand Field Tuning of Photoreactivity: Contrasting Low-spin and High-spin Fe(III)-Azido Complexes\"", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68b8645b23be8e43d6badb8c/original/supporting-information-for-ligand-field-tuning-of-photoreactivity-contrasting-low-spin-and-high-spin-fe-iii-azido-complexes.pdf"}]</p></details> |
