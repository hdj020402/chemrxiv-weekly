Despite its therapeutic promise, TIMP2 has long been considered 'undruggable' due to its cryptic surface topology and lack of canonical active sites.  We present a novel computational pipeline integrating CNS-filtered virtual screening, ADMET and toxicity filtering, and allosteric site targeting to identify small-molecule modulators of TIMP2. Using a representative sampling of over 500,000 ligands from the ZINC20 database, we performed structure-based docking against two putative allosteric sites (a canonical MMP-2-facing surface and a newly characterized cryptic cleft). Visualization via PyMOL revealed plausible binding conformations supporting selective engagement with the cryptic allosteric pocket.  Our findings challenge the notion of TIMP2 as an undruggable protein and establish a reproducible framework for targeting low-tractability proteins through AI-assisted virtual screening and multi-objective optimization.  </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplemental Materials", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691bc5a4a10c9f5ca13bcfbc/original/supplemental-materials.zip"}]</p></details> |

The impact of this scaling on practical downstream performance remains unclear, however. We systematically evaluate how model size and dataset size affect encoder–decoder transformers trained on paired textual molecular representations. We find that, beyond a minimal threshold, further model scaling yields no gains in hit generation rate, while dataset scaling gives diminishing returns. We further introduce a dataset diversification strategy that substantially increases hit diversity with minimal change in hit rate. These results suggest that, for molecular hit discovery, data curation and diversity may be more impactful than continued scaling of model size or dataset volume, and they motivate a shift from scale-first to diversity-first training paradigms.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information for Diversity Beats Size Scaling for Chemical Language Models", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690e364f113cc7cfffc2bc2f/original/supplementary-information-for-diversity-beats-size-scaling-for-chemical-language-models.pdf"}]</p></details> |

We identify several key molecular properties that are critical to produce valid TMCs which we use for prompt engineering, creating  TMC-Llama models that generate unique, novel, and structurally validated TMCs at high success rates, and exceeding the performance of both standard benchmarks as well as state-of-the-art generative methods in the literature. We use the pydentate workflow to show that the TMC-Llama model generates new TMC chemistries that are physically realistic, synthetically plausible, and geometrically consistent with large datasets of known experimental TMCs. Our study lays the groundwork for future TMC-Llama generative model applications to discover new TMCs for functional materials for catalysis, photochemistry, medicine, and sustainability technologies.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "SI for Exploring Transition Metal Complexes with Large Language Models", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6913706665a54c2d4aac10d4/original/si-for-exploring-transition-metal-complexes-with-large-language-models.pdf"}]</p></details> |

To mitigate hysteresis, a proposed strategy is to include nucleation sites on the walls of the mesoporous material to facilitate droplet and bubble formation, lowering the free energy barriers to the respective phase transitions. It is unclear, however, what combination of adsorbate—adsorbent interactions and spatial patterning would be beneficial for a given application, considering that improvements to some sorption properties may come at the expense of other attributes. To understand these interconnected observables, we examine a model system, a planar slit-pore with tunable interaction sites, using GPU-accelerated transition matrix Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations provide a free energy map of the pressure—adsorption space in a matter of minutes, which we use to track adsorption isotherm characteristics as a function of adsorbent properties. We then leverage the rapid acquisition of simulation data to construct a genetic algorithm to iteratively modify interaction sites of the slit-pore wall to minimize the hysteresis of this system without sacrificing uptake. We find that the adsorption branch of the isotherm is easily modulated via the average host—guest interaction strength, but desorption is only adjustable if there is a suitable bubble nucleation site. Within the context of our model system, we identify relative interaction strengths and patch sizes required to gain control over both branches of the hysteresis loop.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information: Adsorption Hysteresis Under Control: Tuning Host\u2014Guest Interactions via a Genetic Algorithm", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69136192a10c9f5ca1bfee33/original/supplementary-information-adsorption-hysteresis-under-control-tuning-host-guest-interactions-via-a-genetic-algorithm.pdf"}]</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce the Exponential Scaling Formation Consumption Neural Network (+/- ExpNet), a physics-inspired neural network architecture that can learn kinetics directly from integral reactor data and easily integrates with computational fluid dynamics to accelerate multiscale reactive simulations. The +/- ExpNet models latent formation and consumption rates which are subtracted to compute source terms, and enforces atom conservation as a hard constraint by exploiting the principles of elementary reaction kinetics.  Using two catalytic and one non-catalytic test case we demonstrate that this relatively simple approach represents source terms with surprising accuracy, in most cases en par with previous approaches that require significantly more specific knowledge of the reaction system.  Further, we employ the +/- ExpNet to extract kinetics for the direct DME synthesis using integral reactor data from literature. In doing so, we simultaneously derive kinetic models for both catalysts in this dual-catalyst system,  without having to specify the global reactions occurring on the two catalysts or any thermodynamic constraints. This demonstrates that the +/- ExpNet provides a general and interpretable framework for automated kinetic modeling and efficient multiscale reactive simulations. Its simplicity makes it easy to integrate into big data frameworks and high-throughput experimentation, offering a path to make accurate kinetic models more widely accessible across catalysis, combustion, and other data-rich chemical disciplines.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Machine Learning; Reaction Engineering | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Electronic Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691b4abaef936fb4a200980e/original/electronic-supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Deorbitalization is a promising strategy to accelerate meta-GGA DFT by removing the explicit orbital dependence of the exchange-correlation energy and potential using an approximation for the non-local kinetic energy density. Currently, achieving both accuracy and stability in practical deorbitalized simulations remains challenging, as many popular exchange-correlation density functionals are rigidly structured and inherently resistant to deorbitalization. These challenges motivate the need to understand the adaptability of traditional density functionals and to develop more advanced strategies for their design. Guided by this understanding, we adopt a physics-informed deep learning approach to reparameterize popular semi-local meta-GGA density functionals into non-local deorbitalized surrogates that more faithfully mimic their orbital-dependent parent functionals. Our approach is investigated for the deorbitalization of the MS2 exchange density functional of Sun et al. [DOI: 10.1063/1.4789414] using a transformer encoder that leverages multi-head self-attention and automatic differentiation to accurately predict exchange energy densities and partial derivatives across real-space integration grids. The outcome is a deep learning-based procedure for deorbitalizing meta-GGA density functionals that generalizes across diverse chemical bonding environments in both molecules and materials using a sparse mixture-of-experts model. The work shows the potential of advanced deep learning architectures towards constructing accurate surrogate models of expensive electronic structure methods, whilst outlining a path towards robust deorbitalized simulations of molecules and solids.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Background: Batch reactor process optimization has traditionally relied on Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for factor effect quantification. However, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and machine learning (ML) offer complementary mechanistic and predictive capabilities that remain underexplored in chemical engineering applications. This study presents a methodological triangulation framework comparing ANOVA, SEM, and ML for optimizing esterification reactions.
Methods: We generated a synthetic kinetic dataset (N = 1,024 observations) from a 4×4×2×2×2×2 full factorial design simulating batch esterification of acetic acid with ethanol. Four operational factors were investigated: temperature (35-95°C), acid concentration (0.5-3.5 M), catalyst concentration (0.01-0.05 M), and reaction time (60-180 min). Three analytical methods were applied: (1) ANOVA with effect size quantification (partial η²), (2) SEM testing causal pathways (Temperature → ln(k) → Conversion → Yield), and (3) ensemble ML (XGBoost) with SHAP value interpretation and partial dependence analysis. Convergence across methods was assessed via Spearman rank correlations and optimal condition agreement.
Results: All three methods achieved perfect ordinal agreement on factor importance rankings: Temperature (ANOVA η² = 0.359, SEM standardized β = 0.603, ML mean |SHAP| = 10.05) > Acid Concentration (0.144, indirect effect through Conversion, 7.68) ≈ Catalyst Concentration (0.105, 0.944 on ln(k), 7.61) > Reaction Time (0.019, excluded from SEM, 3.06). Quantitative convergence was demonstrated by near-perfect correlations: ANOVA-ML (Spearman ρ = 1.000, p < 0.001), ANOVA-SEM (ρ = 0.800, p < 0.001), and SEM-ML (ρ = 0.800, p < 0.001). SEM confirmed full mediation (100% indirect effect) of temperature through the Arrhenius kinetic pathway, validating theoretical expectations. XGBoost achieved superior predictive performance (Test R² = 0.949, RMSE = 2.67%) compared to linear regression (R² = 0.782) while automatically capturing interaction effects. Consensus optimal conditions were identified: temperature 90-95°C, acid concentration 3.0-3.5 M, catalyst concentration 0.05-0.07 M, and reaction time 180 min, yielding predicted maximum conversion of 100%.
Conclusions: Methodological triangulation across ANOVA, SEM, and ML provides robust, convergent evidence for factor importance rankings and optimal operating conditions, with each method offering unique strengths: ANOVA delivers interpretable main effects and interaction quantification, SEM elucidates mechanistic causal pathways, and ML enables high-accuracy prediction with automatic nonlinearity/interaction detection. The demonstrated convergence (ρ = 0.80-1.00) validates that fundamentally different analytical approaches reach consistent conclusions when applied to well-structured process data, increasing confidence beyond single-method analyses. We recommend multi-method frameworks become standard practice in chemical process optimization, particularly for systems where mechanistic understanding (SEM), experimental efficiency (ANOVA), and predictive accuracy (ML) are all valued. Future work should validate predictions via pilot-scale experiments, incorporate rigorous thermodynamic equilibrium constraints, and extend the framework to continuous reactor systems and multi-objective optimization scenarios balancing yield, cost, and environmental sustainability.

Active learning workflows, such as MolPAL and Active Learning Glide, have emerged as scalable solutions that iteratively train surrogate models to prioritize promising compounds, thereby reducing the number of required docking calculations. However, direct benchmarking of active learning protocols across different docking engines and their performance on membrane-embedded binding sites remains unclear. Here, we present a benchmark comparison of four active learning virtual screening protocols: Vina-MolPAL, Glide-MolPAL, SILCS-MolPAL, and Schrödinger’s active learning Glide. Active learning performance was evaluated in terms of recovery of the top molecules, predictive accuracy, chemical diversity, and computational cost. Vina-MolPAL achieved the highest top-1% recovery. SILCS-MolPAL, which incorporates SILCS-Monte Carlo docking scores, reached comparable accuracy and recovery at larger batch sizes while providing a more realistic description of heterogeneous membrane environments. These results demonstrate that the choice of the docking algorithm has a substantial impact on active learning performance. Importantly, combining SILCS-MC with the active learning strategy enables rigorous yet computationally feasible virtual screening of large databases targeting transmembrane binding sites.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Materials", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691a1b25a10c9f5ca1eeaaa3/original/supporting-materials.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Moreover, the instrumentation is 3D-printed, with the remaining components comprising readily available and cost-effective hardware, promoting the democratized use of this technique to generate uniform data sets. Validation with 19F-NMR confirmed PRISM’s reliability. Computational investigations reveal a concerted asynchronous SN2 mechanism, with base-catalyzed pathways exhibiting the lowest energy barriers. To complement the PRISM rate dataset, we developed a classification model that achieves high accuracy for out-of-distribution reactants in determining rate measurability, and a chemically rich graph neural network regression model for predicting quantitative reaction rates. This approach provides a framework that offers a resource-efficient strategy for studying reaction kinetics, which can be applied to other reaction classes.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

The need for an explicit interface is bypassed by introducing reduced electrolyte molecules into the system, whose presence starts a subsequent reaction chain. A series of reaction pathways are identified, leading to a predicted composition of the SEI that is in very good agreement with experimental data from the literature. Moreover, analysis of the structural and dynamic properties reveals key differences between the different metals, such as the presence of additional reactions and chemical species, shifts in the charge distribution of the different molecules, changes in the solvation shells of the metal cations and their impact on the diffusion coefficients.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Energy Storage | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6915c1f365a54c2d4afeebb9/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, many molecular databases contain inaccuracies, such as invalid structures and duplicates, that compromise model performance and reproducibility. Current curation tools require substantial domain expertise and involve complex procedures, creating challenges for newcomers and non-experts. To address this, we developed MEHC-curation, a user-friendly Python framework that simplifies molecular dataset curation for all researchers. This tool allows users to easily curate SMILES strings, transforming an intricate process into a straightforward operation. Built on established protocols, it employs a three-stage pipeline (validation, cleaning, normalization) with integrated duplicate removal and error tracking. The framework's effectiveness was validated through extensive testing on fifteen diverse benchmark datasets involving both classification and regression tasks. Results showed that proper curation significantly enhances dataset composition and model performance across various machine learning algorithms. Also, performance analysis revealed high computational efficiency supported by paralell processing.

Yet, its solution mechanism and the molecular origins of catalysis by protonation and magnesium ions remain elusive. Here we use machine learning potentials trained at density functional theory accuracy combined with extensive reaction path sampling and free-energy methods to dissect pyrophosphate hydrolysis in solution, a model for ATP and GTP reactivity. Our simulations reveal multiple mechanistic pathways and identify a dominant mechanism involving synchronous P-O bond formation and cleavage, followed by solvent-assisted proton transfer. Protonation and Mg²⁺ coordination both stabilize tighter transition-state ensembles and lower activation barriers, although our simulations show that the intrinsic catalytic effect of the ion has been overestimated.

One key bottleneck in the development of biodegradable polyesters is the slow nature of biodegradability testing, which can often take weeks to months. High-throughput screening assays serve as a rapid tool to determine the biodegradability of materials quickly, without the need for lengthy, expensive testing. When combined with machine learning, the data generated by high-throughput assays can be exploited to predict the properties of other similar materials. Here, we report the development of a high-throughput enzymatic biodegradation assay, which has been used to determine the biodegradability of 48 polyesters. Using data generated from the assay to train a predictive model, we can predict the biodegradability of polyesters using an explainable random forest model with 71 % accuracy. Transfer learning and model chaining were investigated as routes to improve the model predictions by exploiting existing literature data.

However, the possibility of diffusion within these tightly confining pores remains poorly understood and computational studies have often been limited to the discussion of interaction energies, conveying only a static picture. Here, we present a computational study using umbrella sampling simulations to obtain free energy surfaces (FES) of CBZ diffusion in a range of all-silica zeolites. We compare results from a classical force field description with a fine-tuned state of the art neural network potential built on the MACE architecture. While both methods show qualitative agreement, the fine-tuned MACE potential consistently predicts higher activation barriers, which we attribute to its ability to capture the significant energetic cost of close-contact molecular deformations at the transition states. Critically, the MACE simulations reveal that CBZ can become kinetically trapped in higher energy, metastable orientations after an initial diffusion event. We propose that the initial exergonic adsorption from an aqueous phase would populate an ensemble of lowest energy and metastable states. This provides a plausible kinetic pathway for diffusion, as the effective activation barrier is substantially lower for molecules starting from these higher-energy states. This work demonstrates that the diffusion of CBZ is governed by a complex landscape of translational and rotational barriers, a picture only accessible by going beyond the interaction energy based evaluation of pollutant zeolite combinations. This work supports the rational choice of shape-selective zeolites as effective adsorbents for environmental remediation.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Transport phenomena (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information PDF", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6915d2f765a54c2d4a010607/original/supporting-information-pdf.pdf"}, {"title": "Supporting Information Files", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6915d31fef936fb4a2f2857a/original/supporting-information-files.zip"}]</p></details> |

To address the high computational cost of traditional methods, this study develops a high-throughput, machine learning (ML)-based approach. Using 407,000 molecules from the COCONUT database, RDKit was employed to calculate and select molecular descriptors. The computational workflow, managed by Toil and CWL on a high-performance computing (HPC) Slurm cluster, utilized Geometry – Frequency – Noncovalent – eXtended Tight Binding (GFN2-xTB) for electronic structure calculations with Boltzmann weighting across multiple conformational states. Three ensemble methods, namely Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR), Random Forrest Regression (RFR) and a Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor (MLPR) were compared based on their ability to accurately predict HL-gaps in this chemical space. Key findings reveal molecular polarizability, particularly SMR_VSA descriptors, as crucial for HL-gap determination in all models. Aromatic rings and functional groups, such as ketones, also significantly influence the HL-gap prediction. While the MLPR model demonstrated good overall predictive performance, accuracy varied across molecular subsets. Challenges were observed in predicting HL-gaps for molecules containing aliphatic carboxylic acids, alcohols, and amines in molecular systems with complex electronic structure. This work emphasizes the importance of polarizability and structural features in HL-gap predictive modeling, showcasing the potential of machine learning while also highlighting limitations in handling specific structural motifs. These limitations point towards promising perspectives for further model improvements.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/690c57cdef936fb4a2b27fab/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

First, the synergy between semi-empirical calculations and literature data enables the fast and efficient screening of reagent candidates. Second, artificial intelligence models predict key transition state features without requiring full localization, providing insights into kinetics, selectivity, and reaction pathways without taxing computational resources. Then, these predictions are processed by a Bayesian optimizer to identify optimal, non-generic conditions targeting multiple objectives (conversion, selectivity, output), regardless of the process mode (batch or flow). We applied this approach to probe the competition between the hetero-Diels-Alder and Mukaiyama aldol reactions of C-nitroso compounds with and 3-trialkylsilyl dienes, benchmarking the results against the corresponding aldehydes. Experimental validation confirmed the in silico predictions and highlighted distinct reactivity trends across electrophiles and dienes. Overall, this methodology provides a general and accessible framework for efficient mechanistic exploration and rational reaction design.

Here we construct high-fidelity NNPs for zinc oxide (ZnO), a polymorphic ionic solid with wurtzite (W), rock-salt (RS), zinc-blende (ZB), and amorphous states, using density functional theory (DFT) reference data. To efficiently capture transitional configurations, we combine enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics with empirical potentials, data distillation, and pretraining on short-range atomic energies (A-Train), followed by transfer learning with DFT-relabeled datasets. Compared with conventional total-energy training (T-Train) directly on DFT data, this hierarchical approach improves transferability across polymorphs and stress states. We further introduce effective charge separation, treating long-range Coulombic terms analytically while short-range residual interactions are learned by the NNP. The optimal effective charges fall in the range 0.5–1.0 qe, consistent with dielectric-screened values derived from formal charges but distinct from Bader estimates. This strategy can significantly improve accuracy and transferability in DFT-level predictions of energies, forces, and stress. Together, these results establish a broadly applicable framework for robust NNP development in ionic solids, enabling reliable simulation of polymorphic phase transformations and non-equilibrium dynamics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "FCC_based_sampling", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6910e7d1a10c9f5ca1734b4b/original/fcc-based-sampling.mp4"}, {"title": "SC_based Sampling", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6910e7faef936fb4a24fd29d/original/sc-based-sampling.mp4"}]</p></details> |

many-body fermionic system problem, main the electronic Schrödinger equation. This exponential scaling
makes it computationally intractable to solve, the exact governing electronic Schrödinger equation.
Approximation methods have been developed, ranging from the widely used Density Functional Theory (DFT)
to Coupled Cluster (CC) theory. While powerful, these conventional approaches often involve controlled
truncations which caused a trade-off between accuracy, leaving many systems—particularly those with strong
electron correlation—beyond the reach of ab initio simulation. Furthermore, the famous fermionic sign
oscillation problem is particularly severe in stochastic methods like Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC).
1 Traditional Ansätze are also frequently engineered specifically for particular systems, which results in a fragmentation of results and fundamentally limits the transferability. Recent research demonstrates that with carefully designed architectures, ANNs can not only represent ground states of model systems with high precision but also tackle the sign problem, offering a promising path forward for strongly correlated electronic structure calculations.2,3 This review charts the paradigm shift driven by Neural Network Quantum States (NNQS), which leverage the representational power of deep learning to overcome these barriers. We detail the architectural evolution from Restricted Boltzmann Machines to autoregressive models like RNNs and Transformers, which enable exact, uncorrelated sampling and bypass critical
bottlenecks.2,4,5Furthermore, we explore the geometric foundation of high-efficiency optimization via the neural
networks, which decouples optimization cost from model complexity.6 The frontier of the field is marked by the
integration of operator learning and hybrid quantum-classical frameworks, such as Reinforcement Learning for
contracted quantum eigen-solvers and Quantum-Enhanced Neural Networks, which leverage quantum processors to enhance expressivity for hardware-efficient Ansätze.7,8 By framing the problem through the lens of computational resource allocation—specifically, trading exponential memory demands for polynomialcomplexity optimization and sampling—this review elucidates how recent advances at the intersection of artificial neural networks and quantum computing have evolved. The emergence of those methods not merely progress into a powerful simulation-tools, but also a hybrid computational interface.9 This convergence offers a versatile and systematically improvable framework for potentially addressing some of the most challenging
problems in quantum physics and chemistry.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Crizotinib, an ALK inhibitor, initially succeeded as a treatment for such cancers before mutations caused its failure. We investigated the mechanism of resistance due to mutations like C1156Y, L1196M, G1269A, L1198F, and C1156Y/L1198F through validated computational methods and published experimental data. Our analysis reveals that these mutations do not reduce the binding affinity or alter the binding conformation of crizotinib, consistent with published X-ray crystallographic and biochemical data. This study is the first to show the conformational change in ALK's activation loop (\textbf{A-loop}) due to phosphorylation, as there is no experimental structure for phosphorylated ALK. Principal component analysis confirms that A-loop dynamics is primarily responsible for ALK activation, explaining the changes in catalytic efficiency due to phosphorylation or mutants like C1156Y and L1198F. Our results conclusively demonstrate that mutations like C1156Y influence A-loop dynamics, leading to an ATP-independent activation. Therefore, ATP competitive inhibitors like crizotinib will inevitably lose their therapeutic effectiveness without losing their binding affinity to ALK.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Informations", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/691a2f6265a54c2d4adbc36d/original/supplementary-informations.pdf"}]</p></details> |

ΔG𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 is a fundamental thermodynamic quantity that describes the free energy change associated with
transferring a solute from the gas phase into a solvent. It is particularly useful for estimating reaction rates and
pathways of organic reactions, most of which occur in the liquid phase, and has important applications in
organic synthesis, biochemistry, and drug discovery.1 The field has evolved significantly, moving from
foundational statistical mechanics methods such as Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) and Thermodynamic
Integration (TI) to more sophisticated multiscale and hybrid approaches.2,3 A central and persistent challenge
is the delicate balance between achieving high accuracy in quantum mechanical descriptions of electronic

report provides an overview of the theoretical frameworks, implementations, and predictive accuracy of
commonly used methods for calculating solvation free energy ΔG𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 , assessing alchemical methods,
quantum chemistry methods, hybrid QM/MM approaches, while also addressing practical considerations.

to accelerate these calculations, making rigorous, large-scale free energy simulations feasible and better
balancing the cost-accuracy trade-off that has long constrained the field.5,6

Stat. Ionics 429, 116967 (2025)] provide a guide for performing molecular dynamics simulations of ion transport, including methods for estimating diffusion coefficients and their uncertainties from mean-squared displacement (MSD) data. The discussion of uncertainty in estimated diffusion coefficients presents the statistical properties of specific analysis protocols—ordinary least squares regression with particular data processing choices and other, statistically equivalent, approaches—without explicitly stating the scope of applicability for these results. Without explicit scope statements, the guide presents these results as universal characteristics of diffusion coefficient estimation; i.e., uncertainty in D* is determined only by the input simulation data. Here, we clarify that for diffusion coefficients estimated by linear regression of MSD data, the uncertainty depends not only on the input simulation data, but also on the choice of statistical estimator (OLS, WLS, GLS) and data processing decisions (fitting window extent, time-averaging). By clarifying this dependence on analysis protocol, we hope to help researchers avoid incorrect uncertainty estimates and encourage the adoption of statistically efficient methods for analyzing molecular dynamics simulations.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Hierarchical quantum mechanics in quantum mechanics embedding (QM/QM) addresses this issue by localising the highly accurate electronic structure methods to a region of chemical interest, with the wider environment represented using a less expensive embedding environment. However, implementing embedding procedures into established QM software packages can be challenging due to their monolithic design and complex software structure implemented to optimise performance. Here, we present a modular and open-source approach that extends QM/QM embedding to electronic structure codes with reduced development overhead by using the Atomic Simulation Interface (ASI) application programming interface (API) to communicate data objects between QM code invocations. We demonstrate the new software, EmbASI, by implementing the projection-based embedding (PbE) scheme into the FHI-aims electronic structure software package. Example calculations performed for pentanol and organic dimers demonstrate the efficacy of the hierarchical density functional theory (DFT) embedding approach with the charge localisation and partitioning procedures implemented in the wrapper environment. When using a truncated local atomic orbital basis, WF-in-DFT (Wavefunction-in-DFT) embedding calculations demonstrate speed-ups of 32× for RPA@PBE-in-PBE relative to a full RPA@PBE calculation while introducing minimal errors to the total energies of the embedding simulations (<1 kJ/mol).</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information for A General Pythonic Framework for DFT-in-DFT and WF-in-DFT Embedding", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6915cf02ef936fb4a2f21bc1/original/supplementary-information-for-a-general-pythonic-framework-for-dft-in-dft-and-wf-in-dft-embedding.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Although generative inverse design is more efficient than trial-and-error or forward prediction–screening strategies, the imperfect validity of current polymer generative models prevents their seamless integration into scientific discovery workflows. Moreover, their limited controllability—such as the inability to reliably generate polymers with specific functional groups or classes—further constrains their practical utility. In this work, we integrate the robust Group SELFIES method with the state-of-the-art polymer generator PolyTAO to achieve generating 100% chemically valid polymer structures, removing a longstanding bottleneck in polymer design. Compared with previous polymer generation models, this work can generate—on demand—polymers that match specified chemical motifs, polymer classes, and target properties across an effectively unbounded chemical space. We further introduce a task-agnostic, continuous pretraining strategy that combines physics-informed heuristics with reinforcement learning. This approach preserves strong generative performance on user-defined tasks, even in low-data regimes. As a proof of concept, we rigorously validated the dielectric constants of 30 polyimides generated via controlled, on-demand design using first-principles calculations, finding deviations of less than 10% from their target values. Designed as a powerful backend engine for polymer inverse design, our model is deployment-ready, and integrates seamlessly with high-throughput, self-driving laboratories and industrial synthesis pipelines.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Organic Polymers; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

In this first communication, we demonstrate how this method is applicable, for instance, to operators of the unitary group, such as E_ij, and to the matrix elements of the one-electron density matrix, as explicitly demonstrated herein. Unlike the traditional unitary group approach, which relies on recurrence relations to compute all possible matrix elements, or the graphical unitary group approach, which derives expressions for segment values used in a product-like construction of matrix elements via induction, the method introduced here takes a fundamentally different route. We show that segment values can be directly obtained from the action of the creation operators defining the genealogical CSFs, interacting with the creation and annihilation operators of the unitary group operator. This formulation not only resolves the ambiguity inherent in the segment values of the graphical unitary group approach but also facilitates a straightforward extension to matrix elements involving the one-particle triplet operator - the subject of a subsequent communication.

To address it, we introduce Neural Network Extended Tight-Binding (NN-xTB), a Hamiltonian-preserving scheme that augments the GFN2-xTB operator with small, bounded, environment-dependent shifts to a compact set of physically interpretable parameters predicted by neural network. NN-xTB confines learning to atom/shell local parameters and to a few global scalings, enhancing local chemical adaptivity while preserving analytic long-range limits, native charge and spin treatment, and self-consistency, and ensuring that all observables are derived from a single adapted electronic state.          
Across complementary benchmarks, NN-xTB attains DFT-like accuracy at near-xTB cost. On GMTKN55 it achieves a WTMAD-2 of 4 kcal/mol (versus 25 kcal/mol for GFN2-xTB and 9.3 kcal/mol for g-xTB). Relative to strong equivariant machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), NN-xTB yields the lowest force MAE on eight out of ten rMD17 molecules and delivers 10-40% RMSE reductions on large subsets of MACEOFF23 and SPICE. Under temperature shift on the 3BPA dataset, errors remain substantially below competing MLIPs up to 1200 K, indicating stronger out-of-distribution generalization. On VQM24, the vibrational-frequency MAE drops from 200.6 cm^{-1} (GFN2-xTB) to 12.7 cm^{-1} (more than 90% reduction). The neural component adds less than 20% wall-time overhead, preserving the throughput that motivates semi-empirical quantum methods.          
By adapting the Hamiltonian rather than directly regressing energies or forces, NN-xTB bridges much of the accuracy gap to DFT while retaining interpretability, correct asymptotics, and robustness, offering a practical route to quantum-accurate molecular simulation and modeling at scale.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Quantum Mechanics | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information: Machine-Learning Adaptivity, DFT-Level Accuracy, and Semi-Empirical Quantum-Chemistry Speed with Neural-Network Extended Tight-Binding", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6913ac95ef936fb4a2a8ec3c/original/supplementary-information-machine-learning-adaptivity-dft-level-accuracy-and-semi-empirical-quantum-chemistry-speed-with-neural-network-extended-tight-binding.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This lack of reliability has hampered its use towards modeling surface chemistry and physics. Our studies on MgO(001) surface, show that the root-cause for such discrepancies is density-driven errors rather than deficiencies in the exchange-correlation functional or errors from empirical dispersion-corrections. For the post-KS random phase approximation (RPA) method, which incorporates dispersion interactions in a parameter-free manner, the density corrections based on the RPA singles (RPAS) method reduces the errors in RPA significantly, leading to remarkable agreement with high-level wavefunction methods while correctly predicting the order of small-molecule interactions with MgO(001) surface. Similar improvements are observed for the r$^2$SCAN-D4 functional, an empirically dispersion-corrected meta-GGA functional, by using the Hartree-Fock density.
