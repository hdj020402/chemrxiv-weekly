We further show that incorporating this heuristic into machine learning models for magnetism improves the prediction. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bonding; Magnetism; Artificial Intelligence; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

The model incorporates six pivotal physicochemical properties as conditions: molecular weight, number of non-hydrogen atoms, ring count, hydrophobicity, quantitative estimation of drug-likeness (QED), and synthetic accessibility score (SAS). By integrating these specific attributes, the generator successfully produced a high-QED database, consisting of approximately 2 million molecules, all exhibiting a QED higher than 0.9. This achievement not only demonstrates the model's effectiveness in generating structurally diverse and potentially pharmacologically viable molecules but also underscores its utility in accelerating drug discovery processes.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |
| **[Discovery of new salt hydration reactions for thermochemical heat storage: from deep-learning predictions to experimental validation](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68947d7d728bf9025e47aa98/original/discovery-of-new-salt-hydration-reactions-for-thermochemical-heat-storage-from-deep-learning-predictions-to-experimental-validation.pdf)** | 2025-08-14 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1814n | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reversible hydration reactions of solid salts are among the most promising platforms for compact, sustainable heat storage, offering high energy densities, long-term cyclability, and tunable operational temperatures. Yet, the rational discovery of new salt hydrates with optimal thermochemical performance remains a formidable challenge, constrained by the enormous chemical design space—exceeding 10^8 possible reactions, per our estimation—and the scarcity of experimental or simulation data—available for less than 6000 reactions. Here, we report a robust deep learning framework that enables direct prediction of key thermodynamic properties of salt hydration reactions from chemical composition alone. By leveraging stoichiometry-based representations, we construct and benchmark a suite of deep neural network architectures—based on physico-chemical features, chemical element presence or chemical element context as determined by attention mechanisms—capable of learning complex, non-linear chemical trends without explicit structural input. Our models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on a curated dataset of (de)hydration reactions, outperforming previous non-deep-learning approaches. We harness these models to perform large-scale screening across previously unexplored regions of the salt–hydrate space and experimentally validate highly promising candidates using differential scanning calorimetry. For the successfully synthesized candidates, our deep learning models demonstrate excellent precision and accuracy. By integrating data-driven prediction with experimental validation, our approach offers a powerful and scalable pathway for accelerating the discovery of salt hydrates, with strong potential to advance the development of thermal energy storage materials for sustainable energy applications.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6899dab6728bf9025efdc330/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

By simulating fracture using quasi-static pulling of the CNT structures, we simulated the fracture of 186 CNTs ranging from 476 atoms up to 5616 atoms in size. Our results reveal clear trends in the fracture strains for armchair, zigzag, and chiral CNTs. In particular, armchair nanotubes tend to exhibit localized bond scission near the ends of the supercell, while zigzag nanotubes suffer more distributed bond breakage along their length. This observation is consistent with previous molecular dynamics simulations. We validate the model's performance by comparing its predicted fracture strains with published empirical model. In addition, we highlight specific CNT configurations with notably high or low fracture strains, shedding light on the interplay between chirality, diameter, and defect propagation mechanisms. The demonstrated predictive power of this machine learning potential underscores its promise for large-scale, high-throughput fracture simulations of CNTs and potentially other nanomaterials.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Based Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Fuel Mixture Properties with Limited Data](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689308a023be8e43d6f1f87b/original/a-graph-based-machine-learning-framework-for-predicting-fuel-mixture-properties-with-limited-data.pdf)** | 2025-08-11 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hw9ff | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate prediction of fuel mixture properties is essential for the development of alternative fuels, yet remains challenging under data-scarce conditions due to the combinatorial complexity of multi-component systems. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of three machine learning (ML) strategies—feature engineering, transfer learning, and delta learning—to improve the prediction of key fuel properties, including derived cetane number (DCN), flashpoint, and viscosity. Using a graph-based deep learning framework based on the Directed Message Passing Neural Network (DMPNN), we encode molecular features for each component and aggregate them using molar-fraction-weighted averaging. Feature engineering incorporates chemically relevant descriptors computed from quantum and cheminformatics tools, while transfer learning leverages synthetic data generated from blending laws to pretrain the model. Delta learning reformulates the task as residual prediction relative to blending law estimates, enabling efficient learning of correction patterns. Among the strategies tested, residual-aware delta learning demonstrates the most robust and consistent performance across all targets, particularly in data-scarce regimes. The proposed framework offers a scalable and resource-efficient approach for high-throughput fuel screening and highlights the benefits of integrating physics-based priors into ML-driven chemical property prediction.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Fuels - Energy Science; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68930aedfc5f0acb52f31827/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |
| **[Materials Dual-Source Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Local Large Language Models in Photocatalysts](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6892f8b3fc5f0acb52f17f75/original/materials-dual-source-knowledge-retrieval-augmented-generation-for-local-large-language-models-in-photocatalysts.pdf)** | 2025-08-11 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bjq11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention owing to their potential as collaborative assistants in scientific studies. However, adapting an LLM to specialized domains remains challenging because of the difficulty in incorporating domain-specific knowledge. In the present study, we propose a framework named materials dual-source knowledge retrieval-augmented generation (MDSK-RAG). The present framework is a variant of RAG frameworks that enables domain adaptation of a local LLM without fine-tuning and is applied to metal-sulfide photocatalyst studies. Experimental results stored in a CSV file and scientific literature written as PDF files were used as sources of domain-specific knowledge by the two retrievers of the present MDSK-RAG. The tabular data were converted into natural scientific language according to a predefined template to improve their interpretability. The texts retrieved from both sources were summarized before response generation using the local LLM. The summary is performed by the LLM based on a predefined prompt that extracts information corresponding to five aspects of metal-sulfide photocatalysts: composition, crystal structure type, synthesis method, reaction conditions, and hydrogen evolution activity. The evaluation of the generated responses to 12 expert-defined questions revealed that the present MDSK-RAG improved the scientific quality of the responses in terms of both factual correctness and expert-specific reasoning. The proposed framework can operate entirely in a local environment and offers advantages in terms of data confidentiality. In addition, a user-friendly application was developed to support its practical use in materials development workflows. The proposed framework can be generalized and adapted to a broad range of materials research domains.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Photocatalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

To advance the ability of machine learning to go beyond the “edge” of their training chemical space, we introduce a joint modeling approach that combines molecular property prediction with molecular reconstruction. This approach allows the introduction of unfamiliarity, a novel reconstruction-based metric that enables the estimation of model generalizability. Via a systematic analysis spanning more than 30 bioactivity datasets, we demonstrate that unfamiliarity not only effectively identifies out-of-distribution molecules but also serves as a reliable predictor of classifier performance. Even when faced with the presence of strong distribution shifts on large-scale molecular libraries, unfamiliarity yields robust and meaningful molecular insights that go unnoticed by traditional methods. Finally, we experimentally validate unfamiliarity-based molecule screening in the wet lab for two clinically relevant kinases, discovering seven compounds with low micromolar potency, and limited similarity to training molecules. This demonstrates that unfamiliarity can extend the reach of machine learning beyond the edge of the charted chemical space, advancing the discovery of diverse and structurally novel molecules.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

This restricts their ability to model long-range intermolecular interactions accurately. This limitation can be addressed by explicitly incorporating long-range electrostatic and dispersion interactions into the MLP framework. In this paper, we investigate the impact of augmenting high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) with both electrostatic and dispersion corrections on the prediction of gas-phase intermolecular interactions between small organic molecules. We employ a machine learning-based charge equilibration (QEq) scheme to model electrostatics and the Machine-Learning eXchange-hole Dipole Moment (MLXDM) model to account for dispersion. The resulting model, CombineNet, integrates these long-range terms with short-range atomic energies trained on density functional theory (DFT) data and achieves a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.59~kcal/mol (root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.38~meV/atom) against CCSD(T)/CBS benchmarks on the DES370K test set. Notably, electrostatic interactions derived from Hirshfeld charges tend to underestimate long-range effects, whereas the Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) charges yield more accurate interaction trends. For reliable modeling of molecular dimers, the training set must capture both the dissociation limit and the transition region near the cutoff radius. For reliable modeling of molecular dimers, the training set must cover the full range of interest of intermolecular distances. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688a9289fc5f0acb52f2e2d7/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

We present MTAN-ADMET, a Multi-Task Adaptive Network designed to predict multiple ADMET endpoints directly from SMILES representations without the need for molecular graph preprocessing or extensive feature engineering. Leveraging pretrained continuous molecular embeddings and incorporating adaptive learning techniques—such as task-specific learning rates, gradient noise perturbation, and dynamic loss scheduling—MTAN-ADMET effectively balances regression and classification tasks within a unified framework. Benchmarking on 24 ADMET endpoints shows that MTAN-ADMET achieves performance on par with or exceeding state-of-the-art graph-based models, particularly in difficult toxicity predictions like cardiotoxicity and cytochrome P450 inhibition. The model demonstrates strong generalizability and robustness in handling sparse and imbalanced datasets, offering a scalable and efficient solution for comprehensive ADMET property prediction.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

results. By describing only the chemically active region with ML and the surrounding
environment with molecular mechanics (MM), ML/MM models achieve near-
QM/MM fidelity at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling routine simulation
of reaction mechanisms, vibrational spectra, and binding free energies in complex
biological or condensed-phase environments. The key challenge lies in coupling the
ML and MM regions, task addressed through three main strategies: (1) Mechanical
Embedding (ME), where ML regions interact with fixed MM charges via classical
electrostatics; (2) Polarization-Corrected Mechanical Embedding (PCME), where a
vacuum-trained ML potential is supplemented post hoc with electrostatic corrections,
preserving transferability while approximating environment effects; and (3)
Environment-Integrated Embedding (EIE), where ML potentials are trained with
explicit inclusion of MM-derived fields, enhancing accuracy but requiring specialized
data. Since ML/MM builds on the scaffolding of QM/MM, most proposed coupling
strategies rely heavily on electrostatics, polarization, and other physicochemical concepts,
the development and analysis of ML/MM schemes sits naturally at the intersection
of physical chemistry and modern data science. This review surveys the
conceptual foundations of ML/MM schemes, classify existing implementations, and
highlights key applications and open challenges, providing a critical snapshot of the
current state-of-the-art and positioning ML/MM not merely as a computational alternative,
but as the natural evolution of QM/MM towards data-driven, scalable
multiscale modeling.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Coherences encode critical information about the phase and dynamics of a system, and their interaction with its environment. Particularly, the ultrafast charge transfer process between electron donor and acceptor species in functional energy materials is influenced by vibronic coherences. A key limitation arises from the dephasing of coherences due to dissipation, causing loss of information and limiting applications of molecular systems. Extending and controlling coherence lifetimes would enable the rational design of smarter materials with optimised properties. Here we introduce a novel idea using chirped excitations as a pathway to extend quantum coherence lifetimes, enhancing their robustness against dissipation. A detailed analysis of the light-induced molecular quantum dynamics and wave packet evolution from first-principles models constructed at the donor–acceptor heterojunction of an organic photovoltaic blend is discussed. We demonstrate that tuning the chirp of the excitation pulse, vibronic coherence lifetimes can be extended up to the picosecond timescale. Chirped excitations also enable tunable spatial localisation of the induced wave packet, with localisation controlled by the chirp intensity. These effects are observed consistently across different donor–acceptor adducts selected from the molecular dynamics structure of the blend. Our results introduce a new degree of freedom for coherent control in molecular systems, offering a promising pathway toward the development of advanced functional energy materials and applications in molecular quantum information science. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information: Extending Quantum Coherence Lifetimes in Nonadiabatic Dissipative Molecular Systems with Chirped Pulses", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689a07de23be8e43d6c85293/original/supplementary-information-extending-quantum-coherence-lifetimes-in-nonadiabatic-dissipative-molecular-systems-with-chirped-pulses.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Notably, the one-electron transfer is inevitable in molecular wires and switches, for which traditional density functional theory (DFT) and long-range corrected self-consistent-charge density functional tight binding (LC-DFTB) meet significant challenges. Inspired by previous studies on constrained configuration interaction schemes, we present restriction-based configuration interaction (RCI) LC-DFTB, a novel extension of LC-DFTB to deliver an accurate description of one-electron transfer under external electric fields. This approach retains the low cost of LC-DFTB while accurately capturing charge-resonance, localization versus delocalization, and field-induced response in large, structurally complex systems. We demonstrate its performance on a benzene assembly and a polyfluorene, showing that RCI-LC-DFTB e ciently describes the effects of molecular conformation and applied bias on electron localization and transfer. Our method thus provides a robust, scalable tool for the design of molecular electronic and organic photovoltaic materials.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Accurate modeling of these systems is essential for obtaining mechanistic insights, but remains computationally demanding. Hybrid machine-learned/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) simulations offer a promising compromise between quantum accuracy and computational efficiency. However, most existing ML/MM methods exclude solvent molecules from the ML region, limiting their ability to capture solvent-mediated reactivity. In this study, we introduce a solvent-inclusive ML/MM methodology that addresses this limitation. Our approach defines the ML and MM regions using a fixed spatial boundary, avoiding costly topology updates, and handles interactions across the boundary using a force-partitioning scheme. We evaluate our framework through simulations of bulk water and the solvent-mediated dissociation of formic acid using different ML region sizes. Our results reveal that structural and dynamical properties of bulk water are preserved for sufficiently large ML regions. Notably, we show that the choice of the potential energy surface representation for the ML and MM regions can affect these properties, especially at smaller ML region sizes. Our calculations of the free energy profiles for formic acid dissociation also show trends consistent with reference systems, but deviations are observed. We comment on potential reasons for these observations. Overall, our study highlights the promise of ML/MM approaches that are solvent-inclusive and provides directions for further development.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplemental Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/689a70a7a94eede15461bd8a/original/supplemental-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

For systems exhibiting strong electron correlation, multireference methods are essential to reliably describe molecular properties such as dipole moments. We derive and implement analytic expressions for permanent dipole moments of ground and excited states for linearized pair-density functional theory (L- PDFT), starting with state-averaged complete active space wave functions as reference functions. Dipole moments are evaluated via response theory as the first derivative of the L-PDFT energy with respect to an external electric field. We evaluated the performance of L-PDFT for acetylene, phenol, the spiro cation, and benchmarks of 20 aromatic molecules. L-PDFT consistently predicts accurate dipole moments near conical intersections and in regions of strong nuclear-electronic coupling. The ability to produce smooth and accurate dipole surfaces for diverse molecular systems establishes L-PDFT as a promising method for spectroscopic analysis and generating machine- learning potentials.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Analytic Dipole Moments For Complete Active Space Linearized Pair Density Functional Theory", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68991f84728bf9025ee94fb4/original/supporting-information-analytic-dipole-moments-for-complete-active-space-linearized-pair-density-functional-theory.pdf"}]</p></details> |

While its importance is widely recognized, visualizing where and how it occurs remains challenging. We introduce the Steric Exclusion Localization Function (SELF), a novel tool that reveals steric interactions in three dimensions, requiring only a single quantum calculation. With SELF, chemists can see exactly where steric clashes happen in their molecules, quantify their magnitude, and identify which atoms contribute mostly to them. SELF transforms abstract quantum mechanical concepts into intuitive 3D maps accessible through the user-friendly IGMPlot software. We demonstrate its power across diverse chemical systems: from understanding atropisomerism in pharmaceutical scaffolds to rationalizing selectivity in catalysis. Unlike traditional quantum mechanical methods that yield only numbers, SELF provides visual insights that organic chemists can immediately interpret and apply.

Traditional enhanced sampling techniques typically rely on bias potentials or elevated temperatures to facilitate such transitions, and the unbiased path sampling methods may be computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new idea towards rapid generation of transition pathways for rare events using a computationally efficient direction-guided adaptive sampling protocol that preferentially selects trajectories progressing toward the desired goal, which may be either to escape from a local minimum (e.g. drug unbinding) or reaching a specific target (e.g. protein folding with known target structure) in a pre-defined progress variable space. This approach leverages the idea that rare events are typically associated with short transition time, but very long waiting time. Our method attempts to quickly identify such transition pathways using ultrashort (tens of femtoseconds), rapidly monitored trajectories (samplers) initiated with randomized velocities, selectively propagating those exhibiting desired movement in a collective variable (CV) space. Demonstrating broad applicability and effectiveness, we apply this framework to diverse rare event scenarios, including multiple ligand unbinding pathways in T4 Lysozyme and Abl kinase proteins, and (un)folding events in fast-folding proteins (Trp-cage and Protein G). Our results show that this approach dramatically accelerates pathway generation (within a few hundred picoseconds) while staying close to the minimum free energy pathways providing viable starting points for other advanced path sampling methods like transition path sampling (TPS) and weighted ensemble (WE) simulations. Moreover, this method is able to identify multiple competing pathways with an approximate estimate of their relative population.

This complicates their experimental characterization, and force field limitations pose challenges for their simulation. Here, we use isotope-labeled and unlabeled infrared (IR) spectra to reweight simulated ensembles of the elastin-like peptide GVGVPGVG, a paradigmatic disordered peptide. By comparing the results obtained with different spectra, we explicitly show that the weights are underdetermined by the ensemble averaged data. We identify which labels and frequency regions maximize structural information while minimizing sensitivity to simulation error and show that these regions report on whether the peptide makes specific interactions. Our work shows the importance of incorporating simulations and simulated spectra at the planning stages of isotope-labeled IR experiments and more generally provides a framework for interpreting IR data for IDPs.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Theory - Computational; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6894de8e23be8e43d62ead97/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

While most riboswitches turn off gene expression, guanidine-I family riboswitches enhance gene expression. Although crystal structures provide insights into the structural basis for guanidinium ion (Gdm+) sensing by the guanidine-I riboswitch aptamer (GRA) domain, the mechanistic interplay between ligand and metal ion binding, RNA conformational changes, and regulatory function remains poorly understood. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the combined effects of the positively charged Gdm+, Mg2+, and K+ observed in close proximity in the experimental crystal structure on the GRA structural dynamics. Our simulations reveal that the binding pocket frequently transitions between ligand bound-like and unbound-like states in the absence of divalent ions, while Mg2+ stabilizes a bound-like RNA conformation. Furthermore, both Mg2+ and Gdm+ facilitate K+ positioning near the binding pocket. As a result, Mg2+, Gdm+, and K+ synergistically increase the structural rigidity of the GRA domain, particularly the P2–P3 junction and the 3′ end near the terminator stem. This enhances localized interactions that pull the P1a and P3 domains together to make the transcriptional control region available for expression. Our proposed mechanism is fully consistent with experimental structural and biochemical (including isothermal titration calorimetry and structure-guided mutagenesis) data and rationalizes how the unique triad of ions work together to influence the conformational dynamics of the aptamer domain and riboswitch function. This information can guide future synthetic riboswitch design and the identification of novel therapeutic targets beyond static structural information.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Metal Ion Impact on mRNA Conformational States", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6893b77423be8e43d6feb4e6/original/metal-ion-impact-on-m-rna-conformational-states.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here we present a theory that allows easy understanding, analyses, determinations and predictions for every possible type of aromaticity. Based on this theory, we conclude that the magnetic aromaticity and antiaromaticity are only properties derived from the magnetic perturbation of molecular orbitals suitable to generate angular momentums, and there are no cause-and-effect relationships between magnetic aromaticity and stability. Till then, the twin property of aromaticity and antiaromaticity could be deciphered uniformly by one theory.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Material", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/688ffa43728bf9025edbd14c/original/supplementary-material.pdf"}]</p></details> |
