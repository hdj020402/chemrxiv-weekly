This evolving intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running the atomistic simulations, monitoring their computation status, analyzing the simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in text and graphical forms. We achieve these goals by exploiting open-source large language models (LLMs, original and fine-tuned), rule-based agents, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. Aitomia leverages the versatility of our MLatom ecosystem, supporting AI-enhanced computational chemistry tasks ranging from ground- to excited-state calculations such as geometry optimizations, thermochemistry, and spectra calculations. Aitomia is the first intelligent assistant publicly accessible online on a cloud computing platform for atomistic simulations of broad scope (Aitomistic Hub at https://aitomistic.xyz), while it may also be deployed locally as described at http://mlatom.com/aitomia. Aitomia is expected to lower the barrier to performing atomistic simulations, democratizing simulations, and accelerating research and development in the relevant fields.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

This entails trying balancing different, sometimes competing chemical features, which can be particularly challenging without the aid of computational methodologies. In this work, we leverage multi-objective optimization methods to help the design of novel small molecules optimised for conflicting pharmacological attributes with generative models. Across three case studies, we show that our approach is effective in generating de novo compounds predicted to have a good balance between desired properties, while also showing potential affinity to multiple targets, even when trained with limited public data. This offers a promising solution for overcoming limitations in drug discovery and design, especially when compounds with a well-balanced profile of conflicting features are needed.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

An intelligent question-answering system is there-fore essential to organize this dispersed knowledge, enhance information retrieval, and lower the barrier to comprehensive understanding. In this study, we leveraged the natu-ral language processing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and the structured nature of knowledge graphs (KGs) to establish a chat model in the field of RFB, named Chat-RFB. By analyzing 5,353 articles related to flow batteries and deconstructing the text content, we learned contextual relationships and generated nearly 164,232 nodes, constructing 853,939 relationships among nodes. This process enhances the profession-al domain knowledge question-answering ability of LLMs. Given the limited research on the responsiveness of evaluation models in the flow battery field, we conducted model performance evaluations using both choice and non-choice questions. The results indicate that by incorporating a professional knowledge base, Chat-RFB enhanced the level of professional domain knowledge. Choice question accuracy was: Chat-RFB 94.9%, DeepSeek-v3 90.9%, GPT-4o 90.7%, Qwen-Max 90.4%, Gemini-2.5-Flash 91.1%. Non-choice question accuracy was: Chat-RFB 93.3%, DeepSeek-v3 75.6%, GPT-4o 68.9%, Qwen-Max 73.3%, Gemini-2.5-Flash 86.7%.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Energy Storage | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Materials", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686333761a8f9bdab5e5eb05/original/supplementary-materials.docx"}]</p></details> |

We show that the same architecture learns the correlations embedded in binary mixture spectra and can retrieve the individual molecular components. Trained solely on gas-phase data, our model attains a Top-10 accuracy of 61.4% on balanced synthetic mixtures. When evaluated on 15 mixtures measured with Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) IR spectrometer, whose response differs markedly from the training domain, it still achieves 52.0% Top-10 accuracy, evidencing strong cross-instrument transferability. The ability to identify signals of individual molecules within complex spectra extends machine-learning-assisted spectroscopy from idealised samples to realistic laboratory scenarios. All code and pretrained weights are released to accelerate adoption and further development. This advance opens the door to automated structure elucidation using IR data in fields ranging from environmental monitoring to pharmaceutical quality control.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

Self-play search algorithms, trained with simulated experience, reach state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods typically plan in the molecular rather than the reaction space, leading to redundant or near-duplicate reaction outcomes in the search tree. In this work, we introduce a reaction-centric planning approach that measures the novelty of proposed reactions, thereby constraining the search problem to genuinely unexplored disconnection ideas, i.e., unique ways of decomposing molecules using reactions. Our results show that the overall synthesis planning search space is much smaller than expected due to the absence of diverse disconnection ideas within the underlying retrosynthesis neural network. Surprisingly, we also find that, under a reasonable time budget of less than an hour, online search algorithms outperform state-of-the-art self-play methods and are more robust to environmental changes, such as minor modifications to the available purchasable building blocks.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

This study introduces the Activity-Cliff-Explanation-Supervised GNN (ACES-GNN) framework, designed to simultaneously improve predictive accuracy and interpretability by integrating explanation supervision for activity cliffs (ACs) into GNN training. ACs, defined by structurally similar molecules with significant potency differences, pose challenges for traditional models due to their reliance on shared structural features. By aligning model attributions with chemist-friendly interpretations, the ACES-GNN framework bridges the gap between prediction and explanation. Validated across 30 pharmacological targets, ACES-GNN consistently enhances both predictive accuracy and attribution quality for ACs compared to unsupervised GNNs. Our results demonstrate a positive correlation between improved predictions and accurate explanations, offering a robust and adaptable framework to better understand and interpret ACs. This work underscores the potential of explanation-guided learning to advance interpretable artificial intelligence in molecular modeling and drug discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information for ACES-GNN: Can Graph Neural Network Learn to Explain Activity Cliffs?", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685c8388c1cb1ecda022dc27/original/supplementary-information-for-aces-gnn-can-graph-neural-network-learn-to-explain-activity-cliffs.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Although Cu(100) is uniquely active for this process, its performance remains limited, and the mechanisms behind improved activity and selectivity through alloying are not fully understood. Here, we combine machine-learning screening with constant-potential density functional theory simulations to systematically investigate CO dimerization on dilute CuM(100) alloys. p-Block metals, particularly Al and Ga, make the reaction exothermic and lower the activation barrier relative to pure Cu, with Al showing the highest activity. Charge analysis along the reaction path reveals that electron donation from these heteroatoms stabilizes the CO dimer intermediate, enabling efficient C–C coupling under operating conditions. This behavior is captured by a strong linear correlation between reaction energy and excess surface charge at fixed potential, introducing a physically grounded descriptor that integrates covalent and electrostatic contributions to reaction energetics.  Our findings reveal that excess surface charge can serve as a practical reactivity descriptor that directly correlates with C–C coupling activity and guides the rational design of more efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Electrocatalysis; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Activating C\u2013C Coupling on Copper during CO2RR: Charge-Controlled Design of Alloy Catalysts", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6865085c3ba0887c33304df0/original/supporting-information-activating-c-c-coupling-on-copper-during-co2rr-charge-controlled-design-of-alloy-catalysts.pdf"}]</p></details> |

By leveraging permutationally invariant Fourier series (PIFSs) within the MB-nrg data-driven many-body formalism, we introduce a new approach that significantly enhances the numerical stability of MB-nrg potential energy functions (PEFs) while preserving accuracy and transferability.  Unlike conventional strategies that attempt to "plug holes" by expanding training datasets, PIFSs provide a more fundamental and efficient means of ensuring physically meaningful extrapolation across diverse molecular configurations.  Using water as a benchmark system, we demonstrate that the MB-pol(PIFS) PEF retains the high accuracy of MB-pol across gas and condensed phases while extending the PEF’s stability to a much broader range of thermodynamic conditions.  Our results suggest that the PIFS-based MB-nrg many-body formalism provides a general framework for constructing accurate and robust physics-based/machine-learned potentials applicable to a broad range of molecular systems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Physical and Chemical Properties | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686576683ba0887c333d027f/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |
| **[Trialblazer: A Chemistry-Focused Predictor of Toxicity Risks in Late-Stage Drug Development](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6863dd95c1cb1ecda07f85f9/original/trialblazer-a-chemistry-focused-predictor-of-toxicity-risks-in-late-stage-drug-development.pdf)** | 2025-07-03 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-8jfc3 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Failures in drug discovery due to intolerable levels of adverse effects remain a significant concern. These failures can profoundly impact drug development, especially when identified during the later stages. Despite the challenges and risks posed by unexpected late-stage toxicity, publicly available data and predictive methods for these events remain limited. To address the need for improved predictive methods, we compiled a new, high-quality dataset comprising 1,610 benign drugs and 246 drug candidates that failed during clinical studies or were withdrawn from the market due to toxicity reasons, enabling the development of classifiers based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The most suitable model (“Trialblazer”) is trained on Morgan fingerprints combined with bioactivity profiles predicted from molecular similarity. Consequently, applying the model does not require prior knowledge of the compound's specific biological target(s), making it particularly useful for profiling innovative compounds for which such information is typically unavailable. Trialblazer achieved ROC-AUC and MCC values of 0.87 and 0.44 during cross-validation. When applied to external data, the model effectively distinguished drugs consistent with their safety profiles, as reflected by pharmacovigilance data from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). These results suggest that the model’s predictions may serve as an indicator tool to flag compounds with a potentially increased risk of toxicity. However, similar to most theoretical and experimental models, the approach should not be used as a strict filter for rejecting compounds. The model is made publicly accessible.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6863fded1a8f9bdab502ea0d/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Our results show that LAGOM performs competitively with, and in some cases surpasses, existing state-of-the-art metabolite prediction tools, demonstrating the potential of language-model-based architectures in chemoinformatics. By integrating diverse data sources and employing data augmentation strategies, we further improve the model's generalisation and predictive accuracy.

In this challenge, participants were tasked with developing models to predict chemical binding to transthyretin (TTR), a serum binding protein, based on chemical structure. The analyzed dataset included chemicals that were screened in a competitive binding assay designed to measure the reduction in fluorescence due to displacement of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid ammonium salt (ANSA) from TTR. The data were randomly split into a training set of 1012 compounds, a leaderboard set of 200, and a blind set of 300. This article provides an overview of the Tox24 Challenge and some of the models developed by the participating teams. Some of the approaches taken by winning teams included use of mixtures, enumerating tautomers, data cleaning. Many of the teams used consensus models. Overall, there has been significant progress in the development of machine learning tools since the Tox21 Challenge. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

MOFs are also recyclable and have low desorption energies adding to their appeal. They are doubly attractive as most current carboncapture techniques are energy intensive, and as such very costly. Using 690 structures from the CRAFTED database, we carriedout Grand Canonical Monte Carlosimulations (UFF force field, DDEC charges, 1 atm) to quantify how thepore‑limitingdiameter (PLD) that maximises uptake shifts with temperature. For CO₂ we find optimal PLDs of 9.16 Å at 273 K, 8.53 Å at 298 K and 7.77 Å at 323 K. N₂ shows optimal PLDs of 7.55 Å at 273 K, 7.93 Å at 298 K and 8.42 Å at 323 K.Plotting uptake as a function of the dimensionless ratio PLD/σ_adso, where σ_adso isthe Lennard‑Jones diameter of the adsorbate, collapses both gases onto a universal curve whose maximum occursat PLD/σ_adso ≈ 3.4 ± 0.2.

MLPs are usually trained using quantum chemical data obtained from traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These MD simulations predominantly sample near-equilibrium configurations on the potential energy surface. This often limits the MLPs ability to accurately describe less favorable, high-energy configurations. We address this challenge by introducing an active learning framework based on the On-the-fly-Probability-Enhanced-Sampling (OPES) method. Using imidazole diffusion in the SALEM-2 metal-organic framework (MOF) as an example, our approach employs a time-dependent OPES bias with expanded temperature- and distance-based collective variables. This allows extended MD simulations of linker molecule diffusion over 5 ns with ab initio accuracy. Interestingly, our simulations reveal a novel ring-opening phenomenon during imidazole diffusion across the four-membered window. This process, which is not captured by classical potentials, suggests the advantage of using OPES-based training curricula to study diffusion in MOFs. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: OPES-Enhanced Machine Learning Potentials Capture Node-Assisted Diffusion and Ring-Opening in SALEM-2", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686224103ba0887c33bef577/original/supporting-information-opes-enhanced-machine-learning-potentials-capture-node-assisted-diffusion-and-ring-opening-in-salem-2.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, the vast number of possible fullerene isomers complicates efficient property prediction. In this study, we introduce FullereneNet, a graph neural network based model that predicts fundamental properties of fullerenes using topological features derived solely from unoptimized structures, eliminating the need for computationally expensive quantum chemistry optimizations. The model leverages topological representations based on the chemical environments of pentagon and hexagon rings, enabling efficient capture of local structural details. We show that this approach yields superior performance in predicting the C–C binding energy for a wide range of fullerene sizes, achieving mean absolute errors of 3 meV/atom for C60, 4 meV/atom for C70, and 6 meV/atom for C72–C100, surpassing state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potentials GAP-20. Additionally, the FullereneNet model accurately predicts 11 other properties, including HOMO-LUMO gap and solvation free energy, demonstrating robustness and transferability across fullerene types.

However, the accuracy of binder selection is often limited by the available scoring functions. Here, we present a novel workflow SMARTDock (Scoring with Machine learning and Activity for Ranking Targeted Docking) that enhances the virtual screening capabilities of GOLD docking by integrating publicly available bioactivity data, a protein-ligand interaction fingerprint (PADIF), and machine learning classification models within a user-friendly Docker environment. This platform-independent approach enables seamless use on different operating systems and is accessible to both computational and medicinal chemists. With only a ChEMBL target ID, a protein  structure file, and a SMILES list of testing compounds, users can build and apply target-specific scoring models to improve the enrichment of active compounds in the top ranks. We demonstrate that this workflow reliably enhances the virtual screening performance in a high-throughput screening context and provides significant benefits for early-stage drug discovery.

Despite the promise of ILs, their targeted design is challenging for several reasons, including i) the vast number of candidate ions that could be synthesised as components of an IL, ii) the lack of predictive methods
to determine what ion combinations will yield ILs with desired melting points, and iii) experimentally known ILs possess limited chemical diversity. In this work, we present a data-driven framework for designing novel low-melting-point ILs. We model ILs as bipartite graphs and apply a link prediction algorithm to identify promising cation-anion pairs, expanding the collected IL database more than 30-
fold, while prioritising low melting points. To further explore chemical space, we trained variational auto-encoders (VAEs) to generate new IL candidates through learning a latent space that enables modelling the data distribution.

Peptides, particularly those derived from venom, have proven to be powerful modulators of ion channel activity, with several already in clinical use as FDA-approved therapeutics. Despite the remarkable potential of venom peptides and proteins, their interactions with ion channels remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we introduce a machine learning approach termed Molecular Arms Race Classifier (MARC), which predicts the molecular targets – specifically sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels – of cysteine-rich venom peptides. The MARC model was trained, cross-validated, and tested on 5,165 peptide and protein sequences sourced from in-house venom gland transcriptomes and public databases spanning diverse taxa, including sea anemones, snakes, scorpions, spiders, cone and terebrid snails. As a machine learning-based classifier of ion channel specificities, the MARC model captures the venom peptides' molecular features consisting of structural and sequence information with ESM and ProtLearn. Key findings from our analysis include the identification of 29 novel terebrid snail venom peptides, teretoxins, predicted to target potassium ion channels. Notably, most predicted potassium channel modulators (19 of 29) were classified with a distinct venom peptide cysteine framework, Framework 9. These predictions were further tested using molecular docking and dynamics simulations, validating the robustness of our MARC algorithm. MARC is a cost-effective solution for screening vast peptide and protein libraries and identifying ion channel targeting compound candidates. This work deepens our understanding of the structural and functional features of venom peptides and proteins (or venom compounds) that selectively target different ion channel classes. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "MARC Supplementary Materials", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685c9e78c1cb1ecda028a492/original/marc-supplementary-materials.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements in enhanced sampling algorithms, obtaining a converged high-dimensional molecular free energy landscape remains a considerable challenge. To circumvent this issue, we employ a deep multitask learning algorithm that integrates deep neural networks with the established enhanced sampling method of well-tempered metadynamics to iteratively learn the MFEP between reactant and product conformations, without the knowledge of the underlying free energy landscape. Our approach improves upon existing pathway exploration algorithms by following a simpler protocol, thereby avoiding the requirement of identifying intermediate structures along a guess path. From the learned pathway, an automatic reconstruction of a mechanistic fingerprint can be performed by following the sequence of events in the molecular process, allowing for a direct characterization of the molecular mechanism. We demonstrate applications of our algorithm to prototypical chemical reactions, protein folding, and ligand-receptor binding problems. Due to its low computational cost and overall simplicity, this framework is expected to find widespread applications in elucidating molecular mechanisms at all-atom resolution.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685e0bd0c1cb1ecda0a008fa/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Lipid-based vesicles are widely employed but limited in real-world applications due to its fragility under mechanic forces or osmotic pressures. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), composed of repetitive (VPGXG) sequences present alternative building block for synthetic cells with structural stability and tolerance of harsh environmental stress. In this work, we present a high-throughput virtual screening pipeline combining coarse-grained simulations, alchemical free energy calculations, Gaussian process regression, and Bayesian optimization to traverse a library of amphiphilic diblock ELPs for mutant sequences predicted to form thermodynamically stable bilayer vesicles. From our screening campaign, we have identified a range of novel ELP candidates with enhanced predicted stability. Analysis of our screening data exposes new rational design principles that suggest incorporating particular guest residues in hydrophilic blocks -- including histidine, tyrosine, and threonine -- and in hydrophobic blocks -- including alanine, phenylalanine, cysteine, and isoleucine -- to enhance the thermodynamic stability of ELP bilayer vesicles. The computational pipeline greatly accelerates the discovery of ELP building blocks for synthetic cells, exposes new design principles for these molecules, and furnishes a transferable framework for designing peptides with desirable structural or functional properties.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.); Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685d77c43ba0887c330dc382/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This is particularly relevant for Morgan Fingerprint (MFP), widely used for tasks such as classification and property prediction, when dealing with large and complex molecular datasets. This article introduces embedded Morgan Fingerprint (eMFP), a method for dimensionality reduction of MFP, while preserving the key structural information of the encoded molecule. The implementation of eMFP offers an improved data representation that mitigates the risk of overfitting while enhancing model performance. Our results demonstrate that eMFP outperforms standard MFP in regression models, including Random Forest (RF), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), K-Neighbors Regressor (KNR), Gradient Booster Regressor (GBR) and a Deep Neural Network (DNN), across three different databases (RedDB, NFA, and QM9), with optimal compression sizes of q = 16, q = 32 and q = 64. These findings highlight the potential of eMFP as a faster and often superior alternative to MFP, offering more efficient hyperparameter optimization in regression models for molecular property predictions, and improved performance with large datasets where high-dimensional categorical data is encoded.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "ESI: Embedded Morgan Fingerprints for more efficient molecular property predictions with machine learning", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685d5a461a8f9bdab5ff03e2/original/esi-embedded-morgan-fingerprints-for-more-efficient-molecular-property-predictions-with-machine-learning.pdf"}]</p></details> |

We note that the variability of the training process, as well as the roughness of the hyperparameter space, impose inherent limits on the reproducibility of results even when the mathematical structure of the model defining a CV is consistent. To this end, we propose the adoption of a Geometric (gauge invariant) Free Energy representation to obtain consistent free energy differences across training instances and architectures.  Further, we introduce a normalisation factor to model gradients for biased enhanced sampling. This factor effectively unifies Free Energy definitions and addresses practical issues preventing the widespread use and deployment of MLCVs. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

In this work, we develop a thermodynamic integration scheme based on an electrostatic embedding QM/MM approach for efficiently computing solvation energies and redox potentials in condensed-phase systems. This method is compatible with both ab initio DFT and semi-empirical DFTB QM/MM frameworks in periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Our PBC-adapted QM/MM model employs a mixed particle–mesh Ewald (PME) scheme for QM–MM interactions and an Ewald pair potential for QM–QM interactions, enhancing computational efficiency. For solvation free energies, we introduce two coupling parameters to decouple electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. Redox potentials are computed using a fractional electron occupation scheme interpolating between N- and N±1-electron states. The method is applied to aqueous solvation of amino acid analogues and to redox processes in water, yielding results in good agreement with experimental data.

In practice, solution-phase molecular tumbling makes alignment of external (applied) EFs with a dipolar catalyst challenging, limiting application of EFs in catalyst design. Enzymes impose local oriented EFs on constrained substrates to obtain enormous catalytic accelerations (10^19), but interrogation of EFs in such complex systems remains difficult. Supramolecular enzyme mimics offer a compact, tuneable solution to studying and exploiting oriented EFs in cavities, as long as catalysis is well-oriented. Here, we show that a recently prepared organic cage enzyme mimic is an ideal scaffold for understanding EF-promoted catalysis due to a precisely aligned covalent intermediate. Using theory, we (i) establish the applied field axis that accelerates the rate of an acyl transfer reaction inside the cage; (ii) demonstrate a significant 71% of the applied EF is translated to a reduction in the reaction barrier; (iii) show that strategic placement of charged substituents on the cage exterior creates local EFs that accelerate catalysis through-space, overcoming the problem of molecular tumbling; (iv) identify modified catalyst candidates with cavity field strengths comparable to enzyme active sites (~0.2 V/Å) and a predicted 10^2 rate enhancement over the parent cage, representing a 50% field conversion. Finally, we derive a generalizable finite capacitor model to predict how local, oriented EFs can accelerate catalysis in dipolar fields.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Theory - Computational; Organocatalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68650f8c1a8f9bdab52c19d2/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, in polar solvents like water, dynamic solvent effects critically influence photorelaxation. We perform nonadiabatic excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of heptazine (C6N7H3) fully solvated in water and identify a previously unrecognized solvent-mediated photorelaxation pathway. It involves direct hybridization between the 1b1 lone pair p-orbitals of water and lone pair orbitals on heptazine nitrogen atoms, bypassing hydrogen bonding. This drives water-to-heptazine electron transfer (ET), forming transient [(H2O)_n]+  n clusters (2 ≤ n ≤ 4) stabilized in hemibonded configurations. The electron–hole pair evolves within a droplet of ∼125 water molecules and recombine on a sub-picosecond timescale via back- ET from a pyramidalized aromatic carbon—acting as an intermediate carbanion—to the hemibonded [(H2O)_2]+ cluster. Our findings highlight the critical role of explicit solvent fluctuations and finite-size effects in excited-state dynamics, providing new insights into photorelaxation and radical formation relevant to the photocatalytic cycle of heptazine.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Energy; Theory - Computational; Interfaces; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Movie of charge transfer during nonadiabatic dynamics of trajectory #7.", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/685eaaacc1cb1ecda0bcac4b/original/movie-of-charge-transfer-during-nonadiabatic-dynamics-of-trajectory-7.mp4"}]</p></details> |
