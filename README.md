To address this gap and support FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles, we introduce a new plugin within the NOMAD platform for managing and publishing heterogeneous catalysis data, the nomad_catalysis plugin. This plugin enables the upload of structured experimental data and metadata with built-in visualization and alignment to the community-developed vocabulary Voc4Cat, ensuring long-term interpretability. In addition to facilitating efficient data sharing, the catalysis app offers intuitive search functionality, enabling researchers to quickly identify relevant catalytic reactions, catalyst materials, reaction conditions and kinetic properties. This infrastructure lays the foundation for advanced data analytics and machine learning applications, supporting more efficient and reproducible catalyst development.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Catalysis; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Heterogeneous Catalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Beyond high-throughput screening, the integration of generative artificial intelligence enables exploration across vast chemical spaces comprising millions of known and hypothetical materials. This abundance of candidates presents a challenge: identifying which candidate compounds are not only low in energy, but also synthetically accessible. We assess advances towards closing this synthesis gap for inorganic crystals. These include the incorporation of thermodynamic potentials (from internal energies at 0 K to Gibbs free energies at reaction conditions), crucial for evaluating phase stability and reaction driving forces, chemical heuristics (from charge neutrality to electronegativity rules), and machine learning models (from positive–unlabelled learning to large–language models) to guide compound selection and prioritisation. Looking forward, the development of more robust synthesisability metrics, synthesis planning tools, and agentic workflows integrating experimental feedback will narrow the divide between virtual screening and real-world materials realisation.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Physical and Chemical Processes; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |
| **[The stability and electronic structure of anti-MXenes](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68eb4cccbc2ac3a0e08e2722/original/the-stability-and-electronic-structure-of-anti-m-xenes.pdf)** | 2025-10-15 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jh8mx-v2 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anti-MXenes is a new class of 2D materials with the formula M$_n$X$_{n+1}$, and has recently been attracting attention. The successful synthesis of Mo$_5$N$_6$ and the identification of its atomic arrangements (labeled as $\alpha$ and $\gamma$), along with the resolved structure of TiC$_2$, raise an important question: What are the possible atomic structures of M$_n$X$_{n+1}$ layers across different transition metals $M$ and values of $n$? In this work, we identify a new structural prototype, denoted as $\beta$, through a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and evolutionary optimization. By systematically exploring the stable polymorphs of 32 anti-MXenes structures with the formula M$_n$X$_{n+1}$ (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Nb, Mo, Ta, and W, $n = 2, 3, 4, 5$), we find that the $\beta$ structure is more favorable in thinner compositions ($n = 2$) and tends to appear at outermost layers of thicker structures ($n = 5$), leading to hybrid structures that are mixtures of $\alpha$/$\gamma$ and $\beta$ configuration. We identify a range of non-trivial electronic states in these materials: semimetals, flat bands, a semiconductor and materials with high electronc density at the Fermi level. Further analysis of M$_2$X$_3$ $\beta$ structures using supercell models reveals that Mo$_2$X$_3$ relaxes into a different lower energy configuration. Our findings unveil the rich and complex structural and electronic landscape of anti-MXenes, which warrant further exploration of this class of materials.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary for \"The stability and electronic structure of anti-MXenes\"", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68eb4cccbc2ac3a0e08e272e/original/supplementary-for-the-stability-and-electronic-structure-of-anti-m-xenes.pdf"}]</p></details> |

A curated dataset of 215 experimentally obtained data points involving [Rh(acac)(CO)₂] precatalyst and 49 phosphine ligands was used. Molecular, electronic, and reaction descriptors were constructed using cheminformatic representations and dimensionality reduction. Among several algorithms tested, XGBoost exhibited the best performance, achieving a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 9.85% for iso-selectivity under leave-one-ligand-out cross-validation. Feature importance analysis revealed that ligand and solvent descriptors most strongly influence selectivity, whereas turnover number (TON) predictions were more challenging. A bootstrapped ensemble of XGBoost models integrated with a genetic algorithm enabled the exploration of vast ligand–condition space, yielding 58 candidate ligands predicted to achieve TON ≥ 330 and Iso(%) ≥ 70. This study demonstrates that interpretable ML models can complement mechanistic understanding and accelerate catalyst design for small-alkene hydroformylation.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Ligand Design | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "ESI", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f0b505bc2ac3a0e0409eb9/original/esi.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Herein we propose a data augmentation approach to generate a balanced dataset of fictive reactions. First, we apply retrosynthesis templates to template-matched USPTO molecules used as products (P) to obtain starting materials (SM). We then use transformer T2 from our recently reported triple transformer loop (TTL) retrosynthesis model to predict reagents (R). Finally, we validate the resulting fictive reaction by requesting high confidence, correct prediction by transformer T3*, trained to predict P from R and SM* with tagged reacting atoms. We generate up to 5,000 reactions per template, resulting in a template-equilibrated dataset of 27.5 million fictive reactions covering the chemical space of the original UPSTO dataset. We demonstrate that a TTL trained on these fictive reactions outperforms a TTL trained on USPTO reactions only. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

With the growing integration of ML into chemical research, undergraduate chemistry students increasingly need training that bridges traditional chemical education with ML methods. Here we present Machine Learning in Chemistry (MLChem), an undergraduate-level course designed with a chemistry-first perspective to lower barriers to entry into ML while maintaining disciplinary relevance. This course introduces fundamental ML algorithms using chemical datasets, such as the small molecule solubility dataset, and the peptide activity dataset. It progresses from traditional ML algorithms to neural networks. Each chapter is accompanied by tutorial notebooks and homework assignments focused on chemistry-relevant tasks. These course materials are open-source and available at https://xuhuihuang.github.io/mlchem. These fundamental chapters are also complemented by advanced modules on emerging topics such as reinforcement learning for retrosynthesis, ML-based force fields, deep learning for the predictions of protein structure and dynamics. By combining chemical context with hands-on coding and exposure to frontier applications, MLChem equips undergraduate chemistry students with both conceptual foundations and practical skills, preparing them to participate in ML-driven chemical research.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Education; Chemical Education - General; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

One such process is the critical yet still poorly understood formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode of a Li-ion battery (LIB) during the first charge cycle, where electrochemical reduction of the electrolyte leads to the generation of decomposition products. MLIPs are uniquely poised to atomistically describe these electrochemical processes, as they are not as affected by the same limitations in bonding and electron transfer as classical force fields. Nonetheless, training MLIPs to run accurate dynamics of a condensed phase with two different oxidation states, such as in electrochemistry, is challenging for many architectures. In this work, we show that by using MPNICE, a message passing MLIP architecture with iterative charge equilibration, we are able to accurately (within 1 kcal/mol) train models along two potential energy surfaces (reduced and unreduced) for LIB-relevant electrolyte systems. Importantly, we demonstrate strategies for sampling and training to examples of anion radicals of these species, which often are not centered on any atom (off-center radicals, or OCRs). We additionally discuss well known limitations of Qeq-based charge equilibration in erroneously de-localizing charge, and test methods to alleviate the impact on resulting dynamics. Simulations using these models reveal new insights into electrolyte reduction and considerations for the realistic simulation of electron transfer processes in the condensed phase.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68efdfa15dd091524f9bfac2/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

While our past work has done this in systematic manners using high-throughput experimentation, the exponential increase in the search space with triple doping makes grid search prohibitively expensive. Here, we demonstrate a closed-loop, multi-objective machine learning approach to guide the high-throughput workflow to efficiently navigate a space with approximately 14 million unique combinations. The test system is LiCoPO4 which we have previously explored using systematic codoping that was effective in optimizing one property only: energy density. To learn multiple electrochemical metrics, we first pretrain a set transformer on the public Materials Project database as a feature extractor, then attach a multi-task Gaussian process head and finetune the entire model on our high-throughput data. Through 3 rounds of active learning, we demonstrate that with a very small number of samples (as few as 125 random compositions and 63 predicted) we are able to simultaneously optimize four key electrochemical properties. Relative to the undoped system, the best composition raises our composite figure of merit by up to five times. This establishes an end-to-end workflow for accelerated battery materials design to be used in the rapidly growing field of autonomous materials discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Machine Learning; Energy Storage | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ee95a55dd091524f6cab41/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

To accelerate method screening, an uncertainty-aware graph-based neural network that predicts retention times across multiple column chemistries and buffer pH conditions is herein introduced. Specifically, the Multiple Condition Retention time model, MC-Retention, incorporates explicit column and buffer descriptors and is trained on a newly assembled dataset produced by screening 480 analytes under eight chromatography conditions. By being able to accurately model multiple chromatographic methods simultaneously, MC-Retention can substantially reduce the time and resources required for LC method screening and development.  With an aggregate R2 of 0.86 and MAE of 15.5 seconds during cross validation, MC-Retention's respectable performance is greatly enhanced for analytes made present during training for one the four column chemistries when those analytes are otherwise not associated the columns being validated.  This selective training of analytes for a single column chemistry reduces error by 50%, with an R2 of 0.95 and MAE of 8.2 seconds in aggregate. Additionally, we demonstrate that MC Retention effectively identifies optimal conditions for separating peptide coupling reaction components, while also suppling calibrated uncertainty estimates for its retention time predictions.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Separation Science; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e6f9babc2ac3a0e0fb41b1/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Recent estimates indicate that approximately 7.2 million Americans aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer’s dementia in 2025, a number projected to nearly double to 13.8 million by 2060. Globally, over 57 million people are affected by dementia, with AD accounting for 60-70% of cases. This study integrates structure-based in silico drug design with ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling to identify and predict potent BACE1 inhibitors. Initially, a hierarchical in silico workflow screened ginsenoside analogues from Panax ginseng, identifying CHEMBL3594353 as a lead with a binding affinity of -9.7 kcal/mol, superior to Verubecestat (-8.3 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulations con- firmed the stability of the BACE1-CHEMBL3594353 complex, though ADMET profiling indicated poor oral bioavailability and blood-brain barrier permeability. Extending this, QSAR models were developed using a ChEMBL dataset of 8,057 unique BACE1 compounds, computing 202 RDKit descriptors. Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, and Ridge Regression were evaluated, with SVR achieving the highest performance (R² = 0.693, RMSE = 0.686, MAE = 0.507). This integrated approach, in- formed by recent studies on ginsenosides’ neuroprotective effects and QSAR advancements, highlights key molecular determinants of BACE1 inhibition and provides a foundation for developing safer, pleiotropic AD therapeutics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "BACE1 PDB structure", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ec8a0bdfd0d042d13bdcbe/original/bace1-pdb-structure.pdb"}, {"title": "QSAR report", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ec8a725dd091524f2c4488/original/qsar-report.pdf"}, {"title": "Docking Scores", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ec8bcd5dd091524f2c5ce8/original/docking-scores.xlsx"}]</p></details> |

Yet most models face a trade-off between accuracy, computational cost, and the ability to capture long-range interactions. Large foundation models promise generality but often come with substantial overhead and energy demands. In contrast, compact, system-specific models may offer a more sustainable path for large-scale simulations. Here, we benchmark the MACE architecture on aqueous sodium chloride, systematically varying model size and the level of equivariance to assess their effect on accuracy, stability, and efficiency. We find that predictive accuracy of the investigated MLPs has little influence on physical observables but is crucial for stability, highlighting the potential of minimal, dedicated models for efficient simulations of electrolyte solutions.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ecd87bdfd0d042d1453887/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Amide couplings, which comprise nearly forty percent of synthetic transformations performed in a medicinal chemistry setting, present a particularly challenging context for predictive modeling given the diversity of coupling agents and reaction parameters that must be matched to substrate reactivity. Amide coupling reaction data makes it well-suited for an approach involving machine learning, predicting optimal reaction conditions given a particular substrate feature set. Herein, we report a platform for standardizing and filtering open source reaction data from the ORD (Open Reaction Database) and using this machine-readable dataset to train thirteen machine learning models. These include linear, tree-based, kernel method, instance based, neural network, and ensemble architectures, in the yield prediction and classification of coupling agents in amide coupling reactions. While yield prediction remained a difficult task for the models due to the complexity of our reaction data, the models performed with great accuracy when classifying reactions to their ideal coupling agent category, including carbodiimide-based, uronium salt, and phosphonium salt. To further validate this approach, we deployed the classification models on literature reported  data not in the ORD database. Our results demonstrate that kernel methods and ensemble-based architectures perform significantly better than other models such as linear or single tree. Additionally, molecular environment features, captured by XYZ coordinates, three-dimensional features, and Morgan Fingerprints around reactive functional groups, boosted model predictivity more than bulk material properties such as molecular weight, LogP, and SMILES.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information for \"Evaluation of Machine Learning Models for Condition Optimization in Diverse Amide Coupling Reactions\"", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ecba44bc2ac3a0e0b5a00a/original/supporting-information-for-evaluation-of-machine-learning-models-for-condition-optimization-in-diverse-amide-coupling-reactions.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Hubbard corrected density functional theory (DFT+U) in a numerical atom-centred orbital framework, has been shown to address this challenge but is susceptible to numerical instability when simulating common transition metal oxides (TMOs) e.g., TiO2, and rare-earth metal oxides (REOs) e.g., CeO2, necessitating the development of advanced DFT+U parameterisation strategies. In this work, the numerical instabilities of DFT+U are traced to the default atomic Hubbard projector, which we refine for Ti 3d orbitals in TiO2 using Bayesian optimisation, with a cost function and constraints defined using symbolic regression (SR) and support vector machines, respectively. The optimised Ti 3d Hubbard projector enables the numerically stable simulation of electron polarons at intrinsic and extrinsic defects in both anatase and rutile TiO2, with comparable accuracy to hybrid-DFT at several orders of magnitude lower computational cost. We extend the method by defining a general first-principles approach for optimising Hubbard projectors, based on reproducing orbital occupancies calculated using hybrid-DFT. Using a hierarchical SR-defined cost function that depends on DFT-predicted orbital occupancies, basis set parameters and atomic material descriptors, a generalised workflow for the one-shot computation of Hubbard U values and projectors is presented. The method transferability is shown for 10 prototypical TMOs and REOs, with demonstrable accuracy for unseen materials, that extends to complex battery cathode materials like LiCo(1-x)Mg(x)O(2-x). The work highlights the integration of advanced machine learning algorithms to develop cost-effective and transferable workflows for DFT+U parameterisation, enabling more accurate and efficient simulations of strongly correlated metal oxides.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ecb3a5dfd0d042d140d837/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This application note describes the development of a novel computational CYP profiler (CYP-Pro) as a drug development tool.  To enable new model development, we integrated and curated the largest, to the best of our knowledge, dataset comprising 26587 entries, including both inhibitors and substrates of CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9. We have built and externally validated Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models that can accurately predict whether molecules of interest are expected to be inhibitors or substrates. The models were assessed mainly by Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which ranged between 0.14 and 0.92. CYP-Pro showed the highest accuracy in predicting compounds selectively metabolized by CYP3A4 alone or by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 without CYP3A4 involvement. All models are incorporated into the previously developed PhaKinPro portal (https://phakinpro.mml.unc.edu). CYP-Pro is unique in that it provides separate models for predicting CYP inhibitors vs. substrates, prioritizes high positive predictive value (PPV) as a pragmatic metric of accuracy to support the experimental testing of a small number of predicted substrates and inhibitors, enhances interpretability with fragment maps, and ensures reliability through strict applicability domain control. We expect that this new tool will aid researchers in early identification of compounds with favorable metabolic profiles, reducing the risks of drug-drug interactions and improving the efficiency of drug development efforts.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

TAS2R14, although the best structurally characterized member of the class, remains poorly defined due to the flexible nature of extracellular loops, particularly extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). We present a TAS2R14 homology model (R14HM) with particular focus on resolving topologically challenging regions such as ECL2. Validation through membrane-embedded molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, MolProbity analysis, and stereochemical assessments confirmed its structural accuracy and stability. Recently released CryoEM structures of TAS2R14 enabled comparisons, corroborating the predictive accuracy of the model and the methods used to generate it. To investigate ligand interactions, a curated library of bitter compounds, including phytochemicals, endocrine ligands, and humulone analogs, was docked into the R14HM, followed by MD refinement and MM-GBSA binding energy calculations. Finally, both the R14HM and the available Cryo-EM structures are compared to the AlphaFold-generated model, and the limitations and inaccuracies in the AlphaFold model are discussed. This work establishes a validated framework for TAS2R14 structure-based ligand discovery and highlights key considerations for modeling low-homology Class A GPCRs, bridging computational predictions and experimental findings and re-emphasizes the need for caution when using structures provided by pattern recognition software.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplemental Information for the article", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e9485ebc2ac3a0e0569fcb/original/supplemental-information-for-the-article.docx"}]</p></details> |

Chem. Phys., 156, 011101 (2022)). This facilitates direct generalization for multireference (MR) PT schemes operating with a one-body Hamiltonian at zero-order. The essence of the method is an optimization of one-body integrals in the first-order interacting subspace, thereby achieving superior performance over M\o ller-Plesset (MP) type approaches.  The stationary condition based extension, performed in the pivot-independent variant of the multiconfiguration PT (frame MCPT, fMCPT), rectifies the shortcomings of our previous MR adaptation. The resulting PT series comes close to the stationary condition-based extension, carried out in the complete active space PT (CASPT) formalism.  Numerical results demonstrate that Knowles partitioning consistently outperforms MP partitioning in fMCPT.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

A common approach involves deriving analytical formulas for new electronic-structure methods, which is often conceptually difficult and requires tedious coding. Here, we implement analytical, semi- numerical, and automatic differentiation (AD)-based gradient pathways for semiempirical Hamiltonian models in the PYSEQM software package, leveraging both GPU and CPU architectures. We further extend these capabilities to excited states calculated using the Configuration Interaction Singles and Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock ansätze. We benchmark wall time, peak memory usage, and accuracy across three molecular families of varying chemical complexity, including systems of up to a thousand atoms. For ground state simulations, analytical and AD gradients achieve near-identical GPU run times, while semi-numerical is slower on GPU but remains competitive on CPU. For excited states, analytical and a custom AD approach using implicit differentation show similar performance and low memory requirements, whereas gradients with full-AD are memory-limited. Accuracy of AD gradients is excellent across all tested systems aided by a quaternion-based diatomic-frame rotation for two-center quantities that ensures smooth energy surfaces. Overall, automatic differentiation emerges as a practical alter- native for analytic gradients in semiempirical quantum chemistry, offering high accuracy with modest memory overhead. Our results provide actionable guidance for selecting optimal gradient strategies in large-scale ground- and excited-state molecular dynamics simulations.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ed43eb5dd091524f4322b6/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, a proper treatment of ROKS excited states requires two determinants, which poses challenges for conventional single-determinant energy decomposition analysis (EDA). In this work, we develop a new EDA framework for ROKS states by mapping the problem onto an effective single-determinant form and applying the theories of natural orbitals for chemical valence (NOCV) and occupied–virtual orbitals for chemical valence (OVOCV) to analyze electronic excitations. The goal is to understand an electronic excitation as the union of a primary orbital excitation to convert a closed shell ground state into an open shell excited state (defined by an intermediate frozen state that is free of polarization effects), with the secondary polarization or relaxation of other electron pairs (defined by the change from the frozen ROKS state to the final ROKS state). Our theory attaches energy changes and electron promotion numbers to each component, and also separates the relaxation process into separate occupied-to-virtual contributions ranked by significance using the OVOCV approach. In this way, our ROKS excitation EDA can yield chemical insights from the energetic contributions of relaxation processes and the accompanying charge redistribution that are not otherwise accessible. The method is demonstrated on several representative examples, including the $n \rightarrow \pi^*$ and $\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$ valence excitations of formaldehyde, the $1s_\mathrm{Cl} \rightarrow \sigma^*$ core excitation of \ce{HCl}, a long-range charge-transfer excitation in the \ce{NH3-F2} complex, and the lowest valence excitation of (dimethylamino)benzonitrile (DMABN) with a hydrogen-bonded water molecule, which exhibits notable intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character in DMABN.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information for: An Energy Decomposition Method for Electronic Excitations in Two-Determinant Restricted Open-Shell Kohn\u2013Sham Theory", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f093df5dd091524fb99f61/original/supporting-information-for-an-energy-decomposition-method-for-electronic-excitations-in-two-determinant-restricted-open-shell-kohn-sham-theory.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Crizotinib, an ALK inhibitor, initially succeeded as a treatment for such cancers before mutations caused its failure. We investigated the mechanism of resistance due to mutations like C1156Y, L1196M, G1269A, L1198F, and C1156Y/L1198F through validated computational methods and published experimental data. Our analysis reveals that these mutations do not reduce the binding affinity or alter the binding conformation of crizotinib, consistent with published X-ray crystallographic and biochemical data. This study is the first to show the conformational change in ALK's activation loop (\textbf{A-loop}) due to phosphorylation, as there is no experimental structure for phosphorylated ALK. Principal component analysis confirms that A-loop dynamics is primarily responsible for ALK activation, explaining the changes in catalytic efficiency due to phosphorylation or mutants like C1156Y and L1198F. Our results conclusively demonstrate that mutations like C1156Y influence A-loop dynamics, leading to an ATP-independent activation. Therefore, ATP competitive inhibitors like crizotinib will inevitably lose their therapeutic effectiveness without losing their binding affinity to ALK.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Informations", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ee4348dfd0d042d1721aa9/original/supplementary-informations.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This study investigates the decarboxylation mechanism across different fluorescent proteins, with a particular focus on the red fluorescent proteins DsRed and PSLSSmKate, to establish a structure-function relationship. A benchmark study was conducted to assess various excited-state methods, basis sets, and embedding approaches. Excited-state QM/MM calculations using TD-DFT, ADC(2), and CC2 methods were employed to explore the excited states of multiple fluorescent protein variants.

To address this challenge, we develop a template‑based automatic fragmentation algorithm that extends the generalized energy‑based fragmentation (GEBF) approach to a wide range of large and complex molecules. A hierarchical SMILES‑encoded GEBF template library for both cyclic and acyclic functional groups enables chemically meaningful and efficient partitioning via structure conversion, macrocycle detection, substructure matching, and small‑fragment merging. Controlling fragment sizes ensures a balance between accuracy and computational cost, while user‑defined templates offer enhanced flexibility. Benchmarks on biomacromolecules, macrocycles, porous organic cages, polyamide oligomers, and ionic liquids reproduce conventional quantum‑chemistry results within a few kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$ (or sub‑meV/atom), while reducing the largest subsystem basis size to less than one‑third of the full system. Experimental‑level agreement is achieved in structural and spectroscopic predictions, and systems with $\approx$1,500 atoms are computed within practical timeframes.

This protein exists in dimeric form, with each monomer containing a retinal Schiff base (RSB) moiety covalently bonded that undergoes trans-cis isomerization upon light absorption. However, the limited penetration depth of visible light in biological tissues motivates the use of multiphoton-absorption techniques, which enhance tissue penetration, improve focality, and reduce phototoxicity, thereby offering a promising alternative for optogenetic applications. In this paper, we present a fully atomistic multiscale methodology for computing the one-, two-, and three-photon absorption spectra of ChR2, where the protein, lipid bilayer, and solvent are explicitly considered throughout the workflow. This methodology integrates classical molecular mechanics (MM) molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) MD, and fragment-based polarizable embedding (PE) to derive environment-specific PE potentials from the explicit protein–lipid–solvent environment. The final step in the methodology is to use these potentials to compute accurate spectra via  PE-time-dependent density functional theory (PE-TD-DFT). Validation against experimental one-photon absorption spectra demonstrates excellent agreement. For the first time, we report the theoretical two- and three-photon absorption in ChR2, albeit without direct experimental comparison. We compare the multiphoton absorption (MPA) spectra where the two RSB moieties are sampled using classical MD and QM/MM MD, respectively. The resulting spectral differences are attributed to variations in key structural parameters that we analyze and document.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Multiphoton Absorption Spectra of Channelrhodopsin-2 via Multiscale Simulation Methods", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ed1ae15dd091524f3e3d04/original/multiphoton-absorption-spectra-of-channelrhodopsin-2-via-multiscale-simulation-methods.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Formulated in terms of difference density natural orbitals (DDNOs), the approach generalizes earlier attachment/detachment and natural ionization orbital models. A compact set of modified Slater-Condon rules derived in the DDNO basis enables direct evaluation of transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths.

and system composition, without empirical parameterization. This review elucidates how this endeavor is built upon an interdependent hierarchy of physical theories, each contributing essential concepts and introducing inherent approximations. We trace the foundational role of Classical Mechanics via the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which separates nuclear and electronic motion, and the establishment of the molecular
Hamiltonian through the synergy of Quantum Mechanics and Classical Electromagnetism.1,2 We detail how
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics provide the critical link between microscopic quantum states and
macroscopic observables via the partition function.3 The review further examines the mandatory incorporation
of Relativity for heavy elements, governed by the Dirac equation, and the formal power of Quantum Field
Theory, which provides the second quantization formalism underpinning high-accuracy methods like Coupled
Cluster theory.4,5 Finally, we explore the emerging frontier of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in chemistry,
where the electromagnetic field itself is quantized.6 The discussion is framed by the central trade-off between
the rigorous inclusion of physical effects—from electron correlation to relativistic and QED corrections—and
the associated computational cost. This synthesis demonstrates that the ongoing evolution of ab initio methods is a systematic effort to replace convenience-driven classical approximations with rigorous, unified physical theories, thereby extending the domain of the first-principles prediction.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

We compare this approach with the length gauge (LG) formalism that we presented in a previous work [APL Comp. Phys. 1, 026107 (2025)] in terms of theoretical analysis and computational results. Calculations on molecular systems with large Dunning basis sets including diffuse functions show a smooth convergence towards the complete basis set limit (CBS) with both formalisms, but LG and MVG converge to different values when CCSD provides an incomplete treatment of electron correlation. With the  small basis sets used in the PBC calculations, the difference between the gauge formalisms increases due to basis set incompleteness. For the PBC calculations on 1D periodic systems, the MVG formalism shows a faster convergence towards the thermodynamic limit with $k$ sampling compared to LG. Furthermore, the MVG formalism provides perfect agreement between PBC and long molecular cluster models. This is not the case for LG due to the so-called missing integer issue. However, a comparison with the molecular data suggests that the LG-PBC results with the small basis set affordable in this work are closer to the CBS results than those with MVG.

In this study, the reaction mechanism of the Pd-catalyzed γ-methylene C(sp3)-H (hetero)arylation of cycloalkane carboxylic acids was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) method and the nature of the counter-cation effect was unveiled. Different from the previously proposed six-membered palladacyclic intermediate formed by the γ-C(sp3)-H activation, the calculated results indicate that in this reaction the β-C(sp3)-H bond will be favorably activated at first to form a five-membered palladacyclic intermediate instead of the γ-C(sp3)-H bond, and that the achieved β,γ-unsaturated acid after the β- and γ-C(sp3)-H activation is a key feasible transient intermediate for the following γ-C(sp3)-H arylation. The γ-arylation product is obtained by the C-C coupling of β,γ-unsaturated acid with aryl iodide, which could be realized by Pd-Ag catalytic model via a Pd(0)/Pd(II) mechanism instead of Pd-Ag-Cs catalytic model via a Pd(II)/Pd(IV) mechanism. The reaction mechanism not only reveals the origin of this unique reactivity, but also successfully explains the experimental phenomenon that the reaction is insensitive to bases, which is significantly different from the previous reports on the β-C(sp3)-H and γ-C(sp3)-H arylation of carboxylic acids.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Organometallic Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Homogeneous Catalysis; Kinetics and Mechanism - Organometallic Reactions | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |
