Machine learning models, especially those based on transformer architectures, are increasingly used to make these predictions from chemical structures. Inspired by recent progress in natural language processing, many studies have adopted encoder-only transformer architectures similar to BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for this task. These models are pretrained using masked language modeling, where parts of the input are hidden and the model learns to recover them before fine-tuning on downstream tasks.  In this work, we systematically investigate whether core assumptions from natural language processing, which are commonly adopted in molecular BERT-based models, actually hold when applied to molecules represented using the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES). Specifically, we examine how masking ratio, pretraining dataset size, and model size affect performance in molecular property prediction.  We find that higher masking ratios than commonly used significantly improve performance. In contrast, increasing model or pretraining dataset size quickly leads to diminishing returns, offering no consistent benefit while incurring significantly higher computational cost. Based on these insights, we develop MolEncoder, a BERT-based model that outperforms existing approaches on drug discovery tasks while being more computationally efficient.  Our results highlight key differences between molecular pretraining and natural language processing, showing that they require different design choices. This enables more efficient model development and lowers barriers for researchers with limited computational resources. We release MolEncoder publicly to support future work and hope our findings help make molecular representation learning more accessible and cost-effective in drug discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

However, optimizing the physicochemical properties of PROTACs, particularly their poor cell mem-brane permeability, remains challenging. Traditionally, PROTAC linkers have been manually designed to improve cell membrane permeability. Although recent machine learning-based approaches have enabled the rational design of PROTAC linkers, no linker design methods that explicitly address cell membrane permeability have been reported. In this study, we developed PROTAC-TS, a linker generative model that combines a chemical language model and reinforcement learning to control cell membrane permeability. We first constructed a prediction model of cell membrane permeability, which achieved high prediction performance (R2 = 0.710). By integrating this prediction model into the generative model, we successfully designed linkers of PROTACs with high predicted cell membrane permeability while considering PROTAC likeness. Our results highlight the potential of PROTAC-TS in accelerating PROTAC development with favorable cell membrane permea-bility.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Electronic Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ad55da23be8e43d60072c8/original/electronic-supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive allocation of Monte Carlo samples for efficient, multi-fidelity computational screening of metal-organic frameworks](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ae61d1728bf9025e7d05d7/original/adaptive-allocation-of-monte-carlo-samples-for-efficient-multi-fidelity-computational-screening-of-metal-organic-frameworks.pdf)** | 2025-08-30 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0mclm | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For applications in gas sensing, purification, and capture, we often wish to search a large set of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for the top-K in terms of their Henry coefficient of an adsorbate. A molecular simulation to predict the Henry coefficient of a MOF constitutes a Monte Carlo integration where each sample consists of inserting an adsorbate in the MOF at a random position and orientation then calculating the MOF-adsorbate interaction energy.

Our idea is to leverage top-K arm identification algorithms, developed for the multi-armed bandit problem in reinforcement learning, to sequentially and adaptively allocate adsorbate-insertions among the MOFs in a data-driven manner to obtain the most accurate top-K subset under a fixed insertion budget. By analogy, each MOF is a slot machine in a casino that, upon pulling its arm (inserting an adsorbate), offers a stochastic reward (a noisy estimate of its Henry coefficient) sampled from a static, unknown probability distribution. Each adaptive allocation algorithm (1) proceeds in a feedback loop of (i) allocate adsorbate-insertions to MOF(s), (ii) update the running estimates of the Henry coefficients of the MOF(s), then (iii) judiciously allocate adsorbate insertions to the next MOF(s); (2) sequentially dials-up the fidelities of ongoing molecular simulations in the MOFs, giving a multi-fidelity computational screening; (3) circumvents the need for hand-crafting structural or chemical features of the MOFs.

As a case study, we implement, benchmark, and analyze the sequential halving, successive accepts and rejects, and narrowing exploration (our proposed heuristic) algorithms to adaptively allocate xenon insertions to screen a set of ca. 300 MOFs for the top-K Xe Henry coefficient subset over differing insertion budgets. Provided with a sufficient budget, we find that these adaptive insertion algorithms can significantly reduce (by a factor of two to three) the simple regret (sum of true minus empirical top-K true Henry coefficients) and error in the top-K subset of MOFs output by a computational screening. By another metric, adaptive insertion allocation provided a 35% discount on the computational cost to identify the top-K MOFs with less than 5% error. We thereby demonstrate that top-K arm identification algorithms may generally be useful for more efficiently screening materials for various properties via Monte Carlo molecular simulations and enabling the adoption of more sophisticated force fields or even ab initio calculations for the potential energy of configurations to lend higher-fidelity screenings. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "supporting information document", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ae647b728bf9025e7d59b3/original/supporting-information-document.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) models, particularly graph neural networks, have shown great promise in capturing complex chemical interactions. Here, directed message-passing neural networks (D-MPNNs) on graph overlays of the reactant and product structures were shown to provide promising accuracies for reaction property prediction. They rely solely on molecular graph changes as input and thus require no additional information during inference. However, the reaction barrier height intrinsically depends on the conformations of the reactants, transition state, and products, which are not taken into account in standard D-MPNNs. In this work, we present a hybrid approach where we combine the power of D-MPNNs predicting barrier heights with generative models predicting transition state geometries on-the-fly for organic reactions. The resulting model thus only requires two-dimensional graph information as input, while internally leveraging three-dimensional information to increase accuracy. We furthermore evaluate the influence of additional physical features on D-MPNN models of reaction barrier heights, where we find that additional features only marginally enhance predictive accuracy and are especially helpful for small datasets. In contrast, our hybrid graph/coordinate approach reduces the error of barrier height predictions for the two investigated datasets RDB7 and RGD1.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ae18e0a94eede154bc19fd/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |
| **[One To Rule Them All: A Universal Interatomic Potential Learning Across Quantum Chemical Levels](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ad47eda94eede154975f3f/original/one-to-rule-them-all-a-universal-interatomic-potential-learning-across-quantum-chemical-levels.pdf)** | 2025-08-28 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ng3ws-v3 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials, a rapidly growing number of chemical space datasets appear. One of the biggest challenges is that these datasets are mostly generated at different quantum chemical (QC) levels. However, a general framework scalable to learning across both chemical space and quantum chemical levels remains in need. In this work, we proposed the all-in-one approach that enables simultaneous learning on an arbitrary number of QC levels from various datasets, presenting a more general and easier-to-use alternative to transfer learning. We showcase the superiority of our all-in-one strategy by creating OMNI-P1 – the first-ever universal interatomic potential simultaneously learning and making predictions at different QC levels. The generalization capability of the universal model OMNI-P1 for organic molecules is comparable to semi-empirical GFN2-xTB and common density functional theory (DFT) methods with a double-ζ basis set, while the speed is orders of magnitude faster. Due to its unique ability to make predictions at different levels, a single model trained with our approach provides a straightforward way to also generate the corrections. This can be used in the Δ-learning models without the need to train a dedicated correcting model. We utilize this capability of OMNI-P1 to correct the DFT ωB97X-D4 level to obtain the Ω-ωB97X-D4 method with superior accuracy.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Inspired by the impact of Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold in structural biology, this study presents a closed-loop generative AI framework for polymer inverse design. The starting dataset contained only SMILES representations of polymer repeat units. To enable property-targeted generation, 17 RDKit molecular descriptors were computed, while available experimental glass transition temperatures (Tg) and mass attenuation coefficients (MAC) were integrated. Since experimental coverage was sparse, random forest surrogate models were trained to predict Tg and MAC, filling in missing values and producing a fully annotated dataset. These predictors achieved high accuracy (R² > 0.99 for MAC, R² > 0.90 for Tg) and were then used in tandem with a property-conditional Transformer that generates chemically valid SMILES conditioned on target properties. Generated candidates were automatically featurized, evaluated by the surrogate models, and selected through a score–diversity scheme that balances performance with novelty. The resulting closed-loop system enables iterative sampling, prediction, and refinement, accelerating the exploration of chemical space beyond what is feasible through experiment-driven discovery. This framework identifies polymers with Tg values near 215 °C and MAC above 0.0569 cm²/g, consistent with desired radiation shielding performance. By uniting surrogate modeling, molecular descriptors, and generative deep learning, this work establishes a foundation for AI-driven inverse design of high-performance radiation-resistant polymers.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Polymer chains; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

We report the outcomes and key insights from an open science community blind challenge focused on computational methods in drug discovery, using lead optimization data from the AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) Discovery Consortium’s pan-coronavirus antiviral discovery program, in partnership with Polaris and the OpenADMET project. This collaborative initiative invited global participants from both academia and industry to develop and apply computational methods to predict the biochemical potency and crystallographic ligand poses of small molecules against key coronavirus targets, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) main protease (Mpro), as well as multiple ADMET assay endpoints, using previously undisclosed comprehensive experimental drug discovery datasets as benchmarks. By evaluating submissions across multiple tasks and compounds, we established performance leaderboards and conducted meta-analyses to assess methodological strengths, common pitfalls, and areas for improvement. This analysis provides a foundation for best practices in real-world machine learning evaluation, grounded in community-driven benchmarking. We also highlight how next-generation platforms, such as Polaris, enable rigorous challenge design, embedded evaluation frameworks, and broad community engagement. This paper reports the collective findings of the challenge, offering a high-level overview of the data, evaluation infrastructure, and top- performing strategies. We further provide context and support for the accompanying papers authored by the challenge participants in this special issue, which explore individual approaches in greater depth. Together, these contributions aim to advance reproducible, trustworthy, and high-impact computational methods in drug discovery, and to explore best practices and pitfalls in future blind challenge design and execution, including planned initiatives for the OpenADMET project.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Figures", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ac00d1728bf9025e22feb7/original/supplementary-figures.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Yet, their selective inhibition remains elusive due to close similarity with the abundant hCA II, whose off-target inhibition causes harmful side effects. Here, we introduce an interpretable machine learning framework to predict selective inhibition across hCA II, IX, and XII. To address this issue,  our approach combines rigorous data curation, systematic benchmarking of classical and deep learning models, and integration of conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification with counterfactual explanations for molecular interpretability.  After extensive benchmarking, we find that Support Vector Machines with extended-connectivity fingerprints consistently outperform more complex models, underscoring the importance of data quality and validation over algorithmic complexity. Here, conformal prediction provides rigorous activity estimation, while counterfactual analysis unveils structural features governing isoform selectivity, together enabling interpretable guidance for inhibitor design. To further test our model capability, we examine it on SLC-0111, as a selective inhibitor, which leads to a compatible result with the experiment. Our model reiterates experimental findings that modifications in the tail region strongly affect molecular selectivity, emphasizing the tail group as a key structural determinant for differentiating inhibitor activity among hCA isoforms II, IX, and XII. To facilitate adoption, we also release CAInsight, a user-friendly software with a graphical interface for virtual screening and generative design of a selective hCA inhibition.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a97cb323be8e43d69e9a63/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This review examines over 310,000 journal articles and patents from the CAS Content Collection (2015–2025), with a focus on, biomedical research, and materials science.
Our data-supported trend analysis finds that since 2020, AI-related publications have surged across both academic and industrial domains. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods, such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, remain foundational, particularly in molecular property prediction and classification tasks. However, there is an increased adoption of advanced neural network architectures, including graph neural networks for molecular representation and generative models for de novo compound design. Hybrid and ensemble approaches that integrate traditional algorithms with deep learning are increasingly favored for their robustness and adaptability. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, BERT, and GEMINI are transforming literature mining, hypothesis generation, and experimental planning. Domain-specific models such as AlphaFold and chemical language models enable breakthroughs in protein structure prediction and reaction outcome forecasting.
Industrial chemistry and chemical engineering are increasingly contributing to AI-driven academic publications, while biochemistry patents have grown eightfold, reflecting AI’s dual impact on discovery and commercialization. Despite these advances, challenges remain, particularly in data privacy, quality, interpretability of black-box models, and uncertainty quantification. These findings highlight AI’s transition from descriptor-based approaches to end-to-end learning systems, offering essential insights for researchers and policymakers navigating its transformative role in science.

Assessing this polypharmacology is essential for drug development. Here we trained deep neural networks to associate bioactive molecules up to 80 non-hydrogen atoms in size reported in ChEMBL 34, represented as binary substructure fingerprints, with lists of targets on which the molecules are > 50% active at ≤10 µM. We included 2,496,555 interactions between 1,187,089 molecules and 7,546 targets having at least five reported active molecules, including single proteins, protein complexes, protein families, cell lines, organisms, and further target types. This represents a much larger dataset than previously reported models, which were mostly limited to protein targets. Our DNNs achieve excellent performance in terms of recall and precision per molecule and per target among the different target types, as illustrated by overall statistics and by a case study in comparison with other online prediction tools.

We introduce the Molecular Equivariant Transformer (MET), a symmetry-aware pretraining framework that leverages quantum-derived atomic charge distributions to guide molecular representation learning. MET combines an Equivariant Graph Neural Network (EGNN) with a Transformer architecture to extract physically meaningful features from three-dimensional molecular geometries. Unlike previous models that rely purely on structural inputs or handcrafted descriptors, MET is pretrained to predict atomic partial charges, which are quantities grounded in quantum chemistry. This enables MET to capture essential electronic information without requiring downstream labels. We show that this pretraining scheme improves performance across diverse molecular property prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. Analyses of the learned representations reveal chemically interpretable structure–property relationships, including the emergence of functional group patterns and smooth alignment with molecular dipoles. Ablation studies confirm that the EGNN encoder plays a crucial role in capturing transferable spatial features, while the Transformer layers adapt these features to specific prediction tasks. This architecture draws direct analogies to quantum mechanical basis transformations, where MET learns to transition from coordinate-based to electron-based representations in a symmetry-preserving manner. By integrating domain knowledge with modern deep learning techniques, MET offers a unified and interpretable framework for data-efficient molecular modeling, with broad applications in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

To this end, we propose the adoption of a Geometric (gauge invariant) Free Energy representation to obtain consistent free energy differences across training instances and architectures.  Further, we introduce a normalisation factor to model gradients for biased enhanced sampling. This factor effectively unifies Free Energy definitions and addresses practical issues preventing the widespread use and deployment of MLCVs. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Additionally, we have observed that a docking-based initialization scheme is often superior to the commonly-used diversity-based or random initialization. Using docking-based features and docking-based initialization required on average 24% (up to 77%) fewer data points to find the most active compound and gave on average 32% (up to 159%) improvement in enrichment factors, relative to a typical BO approach. We applied our method to 14 ChEMBL data sets, and 4 more highly challenging LIT-PCBA data sets with low hit rates and high molecular diversity.

Variants of this approach have been used to parameterize classical force fields and machine learning potentials, yet there are few readily available, purpose-built software packages to perform fragment-based calculations.  To fill this void we introduce "FRAGMENT", an open-source software application that provides a tool for community validation of energy-based fragmentation methods, a platform for developing new approximations, and a framework for analyzing many-body interactions.  FRAGMENT includes algorithms for automatic fragment generation and  structure modification, and for distance- and energy-based screening of the requisite subsystems.  Checkpointing, database management, and parallelization are handled internally and results are archived into a portable database format.

Nevertheless, elucidating the solution conformation of CLPs remains a significant challenge in the field of polymer physics, owing to the difficulty of synthesizing defect-free samples, their intrinsically low solubility that results in weak signals and limited analytical accuracy, the pronounced tendency of CLPs to aggregate even when dissolved, and the absence of reliable theoretical models. Here, these fundamental challenges are addressed by the synthesis, neutron scattering measurements, and computational simulations of two model CLPs, LP1 and LP2. Owing to their bulky three-dimensional side chains, LP1 and LP2 exhibit non-aggregated character and high dispersibility as single polymer chains. Small-angle neutron scattering revealed unexpectedly low persistence lengths (Lp) of 3–5 nm. The similar Lp to those of non-ladder conjugated polymers such as P3HT indicates the long-range conformational semi-flexibility of CLPs despite possessing ladder-type constitution. Machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations further showed that the semi-flexibility of these CLP chains mainly results from the pronounced out-of-plane deformations, which is synergistically influenced by the steric congestion of the side chains. Overall, a comprehensive experimental and computational approach demonstrates that CLPs, despite their fused-ring polyaromatic backbones, are best described as ribbon-like, semi-flexible chains, in contrast to the common belief that they are rigid-rod polymers.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Polymer Science; Physical Organic Chemistry; Organic Polymers; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Synthesis and Conformation of Defect-Free, Strained, and Non-Aggregated Conjugated Ladder Polymers_Supplementary Materials", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ade69ba94eede154b4f72b/original/synthesis-and-conformation-of-defect-free-strained-and-non-aggregated-conjugated-ladder-polymers-supplementary-materials.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Most ML/MM simulations reported to date employ mechanical embedding schemes, and rely on Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potentials to model intermolecular interactions between the ML and MM regions. A promising approach to improving ML/MM schemes is to use electrostatic embedding, where polarization effects on the ML region by the MM region are explicitly incorporated. The electrostatic machine learning embedding (EMLE) method has been developed for this purpose.  Here, we compute absolute hydration free energies for a set of small organic molecules to derive robust methodologies for training EMLE models using quantum mechanical data. We establish protocols for fine-tuning the static and induced components of electrostatic interactions and evaluate the accuracy limits of fitting these components to first-principles calculations. We also introduce an empirical adjustment to enhance agreement with experimental results, strengthening the competitiveness of ML/MM simulations relative to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of electrostatic embedding ML/MM simulations, and offer strategies for achieving robust modelling of classes of drug-like molecules where the accuracy of conventional MM force fields fall short.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Enhancing Electrostatic Embedding for ML/MM Free Energy Calculations", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68add4af728bf9025e641a03/original/supporting-information-enhancing-electrostatic-embedding-for-ml-mm-free-energy-calculations.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The use of the adapted similarity kernel was assessed for several organic molecular crystal landscapes, demonstrating improved interpretability of the resulting machine learned descriptors.

A large theoretical dataset (55 ice polymorphs, 1000 DFT data points both for the vibrations and for the NMR shifts) and a smaller cross-validation set are employed. The Message Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE) model performs best, with high accuracy (root-mean square deviation, RMSD, of 0.06 ppm for chemical shifts and ~10 cm⁻¹ for vibrational frequencies). Simpler descriptors like ACSF and SOAP, when paired with suitable regressors, nearly match MACE’s performance. At the other end of the complexity scale, it is found that using the simplest possible physics-based descriptor of the environment (a single H-bond distance) yields RMSD values three times as large for the vibrations and seven times as large for the proton chemical shift compared to the MACE model. Depending on the context, those RMSD values may still be considered modest and useful, considering the gain is simplicity and transparency.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Inorganic Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Machine Learning; Crystallography – Inorganic | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Machine learning (ML) interatomic potentials can reduce this cost, but they must be trained on datasets that capture the most relevant regions of configurational space. We present MELTS, a fully automated active learning (AL) program for FSSH that iteratively improves ML models by using trajectory propagation to guide sampling. MELTS integrates Newton-X and MLatom through socket-based communication, minimizing I/O overhead and enabling large- scale simulations with a user-friendly interface. We validate the AL protocol implemented in MELTS on two contrasting systems: ultrafast fulvene dynamics (tens of femtoseconds) and nanosecond-scale pyrene fluorescence. In both cases, MELTS delivers quantitative agreement with reference quantum results while reducing computational time by up to three orders of magnitude. This demonstrates that MELTS can efficiently generate accurate ML potentials for photochemical processes across a wide range of timescales.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ac1174a94eede154729a3f/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, ultrafast spectro- scopic studies to elucidate the complex interplay of electronic and vibrational dynamics in these systems focused on the impact of high-frequency vibra- tions. Here we combine experiment and theory to demonstrate that ultrafast control over the vibronic dynamics involving a low-frequency mode in poly(3- hexylthiophene) is possible via a photoluminescence-detected chirp-dependent double-pump approach. By chirping one of the pump pulses, we show that the temporal ordering of resonant frequency components can be used to engineering the initial vibronic coherence induced in the system. Particularly, the spectro- scopic signals reveal distinct symmetry properties as a function of inter-pulse delay and chirp, i.e., delay and chirp can be used to manipulate quantum beats associated to the system’s vibronic dynamics. Importantly, our signals highlight quantum dynamical features associated to low-frequency vibrational modes in the conjugated polymer. High-frequency modes, despite being optically active, remain undetected. Last, we show that tuning the pulses’ central wavelength can be used to manipulate the symmetry and phase information in the signals. Simulations show that the effective interference between the phase of the pump pulses and the photoinduced vibronic wavepacket determines the evolution and symmetry of the delay- and chirp-dependent signals. Our results establish chirp-dependent time-resolved spectroscopy as a powerful control tool to selective manipulate low- frequency vibronic dynamics in conjugated polymers. The interplay of chirp and delay exposes a coherent-control landscape inaccessible to traditional coherent four-wave mixing spectroscopies, opening new avenues for chirp-driven quantum control in excitonic materials. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Polymer Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Optics; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Selective Manipulation of Low-Frequency Modes in Conjugated Polymers via Chirped Optical Frequency Combs", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a5afc6728bf9025e4dfb07/original/supporting-information-selective-manipulation-of-low-frequency-modes-in-conjugated-polymers-via-chirped-optical-frequency-combs.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Establishing suitable parameterizations has long been a challenging and time-consuming task involving tedious grid searches or costly finite-difference gradients of carefully crafted loss functions based on select experimental data. The growing availability of differentiable programming environments that leverage algorithmic differentiation to obtain complex derivatives together with access to a wealth of reliable reference data from ab initio calculations offers a new and more efficient approach. In this work, we extend a previous, basic implementation of SQC methods in PyTorch [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16, 4951-4962 (2020)] by including global algorithmic considerations into the code design. This allows for improved general applicability and establishes a robust back-end for rapid SQC parameterizations. In particular, we address the general differentiability of the eigensolver and the iterative SCF procedure. The new implementation offers drastic improvements in computing costs as well as memory footprint and provides increased stability in gradient evaluation.

Two primary innovations are a self-consistent charge embedding scheme to capture many-body polarization (the "XPol" procedure) and the use of low-cost dispersion models as replacements for SAPT's perturbative description of dispersion.   The latter modification reduces the formal complexity to O(N^3) with system size.   In conjunction with a many-body dispersion model (XSAPT+MBD) or empirical dispersion potentials fitted to ab initio data (XSAPT+aiD), the hybrid procedure achieves sub-kcal/mol accuracy with respect to high-level benchmarks. XSAPT is equipped with an energy decomposition that partitions the intermolecular interaction energy into components that include electrostatics, Pauli repulsion, dispersion, and induction, the latter of which can be further separated into polarization and charge transfer.  As compared to energy decomposition analyses used in density functional theory, separation of the dispersion energy in XSAPT is less ambiguous and the energy partition agrees well with accurate third-order SAPT benchmarks.  Theoretical foundations of XSAPT are reviewed, and we provide a thorough  discussion of its performance in terms of both accuracy and cost.   Exemplary applications are presented that illustrate how XSAPT can be used to uncover the fundamental molecular physics of intermolecular interactions.  </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Among them are very long vibrational lifetimes in the CO stretch mode (∼ 4 ms), efficient vibrational energy pooling, and orientational isomerization from a “C-
bound” to an “O-bound” configuration. Here we use non-equilibrium ab initio molecular dynamics (neq-AIMD) coupled with time correlation functions (TCF) techniques, to study vibrational relaxation dynamics and related processes, after selectively exciting specific normal modes (CO internal stretch, frustrated rotation) across submonolayer
and monolayer coverages of this system. We are mostly concerned with picosecond dynamics, and in one case, we use recently proposed machine-learned, AIMD-based potentials for CO/NaCl, to explore significantly longer timescales (∼ ns). To monitor the dynamics, we present atom and mode-resolved transient vibrational spectra, kinetic energies and qualitative time-dependent local mode couplings. Time-dependent vibrational sum frequency (VSF) spectra are reported for a flipping CO in the CO/NaCl(100) monolayer, following frustrated bending mode excitation. Important highlights of this
work are as follows: (i) Localization of vibrational energy in the CO stretch modes on ps timescales and signatures of vibrational energy pooling on ns timescales; (ii) subpicosecond lifetimes of frustrated bending modes of both “C-bound” and “O-bound” CO adsorbates resulting from two dissipative channels, namely the surface phonons and
neighbouring adsorbates causing successive flipping, desorption and diffusion events;

The MME55 test set [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2023, 19, 8365] is a recent benchmark providing high-level DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS reference values for large, practically relevant metalloenzyme models with up to 116 atoms. So far, the best-performing rung-4 hybrids were MPW1B95-D3(BJ) with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.67 kcal/mol and ωB97M-V (2.78 kcal/mol). This work focuses on range-separated local hybrids (RSLHs), a recent class of rung-4 functionals that use both a real-space dependent and inter-electronic distance dependent admixture of exact (Hartree-Fock-like) exchange. Strong-correlation corrected RSLHs (scRSLHs) based on real-space non-dynamical correlation models are also assessed. The best-performing functional is the scRSLH ωLH23tdB-D4 with an MAE of 2.46 kcal/mol. Overall, the results reflect a systematic improvement in accuracy along the functional development series from LH to RSLH to scRSLH. However, our analysis also indicates that the real-space non-dynamical correlation model is not the primary driver of this improvement, which is instead dominated by other features of the functional design. Additionally, we studied (sc)(RS)LHs for the ENZYMES22 set of enzyme reactions comprising metal-free active site models as well as the ECR20 benchmark of net reaction energies of enzyme catalyzed reactions. MAEs of 1.45 kcal/mol and 0.63 kcal/mol confirm ωLH23tdB-D4 as one of the top-performing functionals for these sets. Due to inaccuracies in the original CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ + [SCS-MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ - SCS-MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ] references values for the ECR20 set, we devise new canonical CCSD(T)/CBS reference values using a aug-cc-pVXZ (X = D, T, Q) based basis set extrapolation. Because scRSLHs have only very recently emerged, this benchmark study is accompanied by critical assessments of their use as a practical tool. We analyze the grid dependence of their semi-numerical implementation in Turbomole and evaluate the computational cost and parallel scaling on a shared-memory OpenMP architecture using up to 192 physical CPU cores.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a967fd23be8e43d69cb666/original/supporting-information.pdf"}, {"title": "Supplementary Tables", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a9683523be8e43d69cbb47/original/supplementary-tables.xlsx"}]</p></details> |

This functional, referred to as cQTP25, differs from other Quantum Theory Project (QTP) functionals by optimizing the range-separation parameters through a targeted restriction of the orbital space to core 1s electrons only. We benchmarked cQTP25 against a diverse set of XC functionals spanning multiple rungs of Jacob's ladder in Density Functional Theory (DFT). Performance was evaluated primarily using the relation $IP_{1s} = -\varepsilon_{1s}$, but for completeness, we also computed core ionization potentials using the $\Delta$DFT method. All calculations accounted for both non-relativistic and relativistic corrections. In general, regardless of the computational approach or test set, the results consistently show the same trend: cQTP25 delivers the best performance, followed closely by QTP00 and then QTP17.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: cQTP25: A New Exchange-Correlation Functional for Core-Electron Ionization Energy", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a8bbb7728bf9025ed2a50e/original/supporting-information-c-qtp25-a-new-exchange-correlation-functional-for-core-electron-ionization-energy.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The reference interaction energies of diH-norm and diH-linear datasets (J. Fanfrlík et al., ChemPhysChem 2020, 21, 2599), which include such bonds both in bent and linear configurations, have been re-evaluated at the gold standard. This re-evaluation utilizes explicitly correlated MP2-F12 near the complete basis set limit, CCSD(F12*)/VQZ-F12, and a (T) correction from conventional CCSD(T)/haV{T,Q}Z calculations. Relative to the updated reference data, Fanfrlík's original reference shows very small root mean square deviations, resulting from significant error compensation between the [CCSD-MP2] and (T) high-level corrections. The new reference data were subsequently used to assess the performance of various localized-orbital coupled-cluster methods, such as PNO-LCCSD(T), DLPNO-CCSD(T1), and LNO-CCSD(T), at their respective “Normal”, “Tight”, “vTight”, and “vvTight” accuracy settings. For these methods, gradually increasing the basis set size and tightening the accuracy cutoffs consistently improves their performance. For the dihydrogen bonds in diH-norm set, two cost-effective and accurate methods—PNO-LCCSD(T)/Tight/haV{T,Q}Z and DLPNO-CCSD(T1)/TightPNO/CPS(6,7)/haV{T,Q}Z—yields RMS errors of just 0.010 and 0.027 kcal·mol⁻¹, respectively. For the diH-linear set, the best-performing low-cost options are LNO-CCSD(T)/vTight/haV{T,Q}Z and PNO-LCCSD(T)/Tight/haV{T,Q}Z, with RMS errors of 0.013 and 0.016 kcal·mol⁻¹, respectively. None of the explicitly correlated localized coupled-cluster methods tested surpass the accuracy of these efficient low-cost methods. Among the more affordable density functional methods, r2SCAN-3c stands out for delivering excellent accuracy at minimal cost. For hybrid and double-hybrid functionals, the incorporation of range separation significantly enhances performance. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Revisiting Boron Cluster Dihydrogen Bonding: Improved Reference Energies and Benchmark of Localized Coupled Cluster and DFT Methods", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68a8628523be8e43d683330c/original/supporting-information-revisiting-boron-cluster-dihydrogen-bonding-improved-reference-energies-and-benchmark-of-localized-coupled-cluster-and-dft-methods.pdf"}]</p></details> |
