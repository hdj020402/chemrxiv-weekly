The rational design of photo-responsive molecules requires understanding of the photophysical and photochemical processes underlying their operation. This understanding can be gained via the first-principles quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations which, however, turn out prohibitively expensive for high-throughput investigations. To break through this limitation, here we introduce OMNI-P2x: the first universal neural network potential for molecular excited and ground electronic states. OMNI-P2x can be used, directly or after fine-tuning, in place of quantum-mechanical methods to perform a wide range of photophysical and photochemical simulations. OMNI-P2x is approaching the accuracy of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods at a fraction of the cost. Remarkably, this universal potential is more accurate and faster than established semiempirical QM methods, marking the watershed moment in theoretical method development for excited-state simulations. Here, we demonstrate its use in UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, in real-time photodynamical simulations, and in the rational design of the visible-light-absorbing azobenzene systems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

MOFid, a text-based encoding of MOF structures, has enabled large-scale data mining using natural language processing (NLP) models. Although state-of-the-art string-based frameworks such as MOFormer have demonstrated strong predictive capability, they still face challenges in capturing multi-scale structural dependencies within MOFid sequences. To overcome this limitation, we propose MCLFormer, an enhanced architecture that augments MOFormer with convolutional layers for local pattern extraction and an LSTM module for modeling mid-range sequential dependencies. This hierarchical, multi-mechanism fusion model enables synergistic representation learning across local ligand–metal fragments, medium-range sequential motifs, and global topological contexts in MOFid space. Extensive experiments on the hMOF dataset demonstrate the superiority of MCLFormer. For CO₂ adsorption prediction at 0.5 bar, it achieves an R² of 0.809 and MAE of 0.375, outperforming the baseline MOFormer (R² = 0.691) by 13.6%, especially in high-adsorption regimes. Interpretability analyses further reveal that attention heatmaps emphasize metal nodes and organic ligands, while t-SNE projections cluster MOFs according to their distinct topologies. Overall, this study establishes a hierarchical, interpretable feature extraction framework that effectively captures multi-scale chemical–topological correlations in MOFs, providing a powerful tool for accelerated MOF design and carbon capture property prediction.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "SI-MCLFormer: A Text-Driven Deep Learning Framework for Predicting CO2 Adsorption in Metal-Organic Frameworks", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68f8c06a3e6156d3be4dbabc/original/si-mcl-former-a-text-driven-deep-learning-framework-for-predicting-co2-adsorption-in-metal-organic-frameworks.pdf"}]</p></details> |

In the lab, the same sample is often characterized from different perspectives, applying different experimental probes to it. Likewise, calculations for the same material are performed with various levels of sophistication, often depending on each other. Workflows for sample synthesis, for acquisition, and post-processing of experimental data, and for managing complex calculations are required to orchestrate these tasks. The huge number of experimental materials laboratories and theoretical materials-science groups, covering the breadth of the field, are working with a large variety of tools, often created in parallel in different sub-fields. In this work, we focus on materials science at the atomistic level. We review the current state-of-the-art workflow definitions in the field of first-principles calculations and provide examples of experiment-driven approaches. We analyze the need for workflows to be interoperable and reusable, and demonstrate the benefits of advanced workflow support within a modern research data management system, using the NOMAD software and repository as a quintessential example.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |
| **[Toward lab-ready AI synthesis plans with protection strategies and route scoring ](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ff62f6ef936fb4a29b02d8/original/toward-lab-ready-ai-synthesis-plans-with-protection-strategies-and-route-scoring.pdf)** | 2025-10-31 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-gdrr8 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven synthesis planning tools are developed to automatically create synthesis routes and thereby aid chemists in making novel molecules. However, these tools frequently produce reaction trees with selectivity issues, manifested by competing reactive sites. Therefore, manual postprocessing is often required to formulate appropriate protection strategies, which prevents full automation and thus reduces the efficiency of AI-driven synthesis planning. Here, we introduce novel routines for identifying competing sites and formulating context-aware protection strategies by leveraging machine learning and human chemical knowledge encoded into rules and data. Our approach considers the critical interplay of cross-functional‐group competition, protecting group selection, and global reaction tree structure. Moreover, the workflow supports orthogonal and multistep protections. Finally, we propose a competing sites-score, which is reflective of functional group-incompatibility. The score enables analyzing and re-ranking revised reaction trees, effectively prioritizing reaction trees with fewer selectivity issues. By evaluating on AiZynthFinder-generated reaction trees, we show that our framework substantially reduces the amount of selectivity issues and improves the quality of the synthesis routes returned to the user, with only a modest increase in computation time per target molecule. Overall, the context-aware protecting group strategy and automated selectivity control offer enhanced AI-driven synthesis planning and thus facilitate acceleration of industrial drug discovery workflows.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary figures", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ffcd22ef936fb4a2aa25dd/original/supplementary-figures.pdf"}]</p></details> |
| **[Machine Learning to Optimize Transferable Hydrofluorocarbon Refrigerant Force Fields](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ffba55a482cba1225bc940/original/machine-learning-to-optimize-transferable-hydrofluorocarbon-refrigerant-force-fields.pdf)** | 2025-10-30 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-32g4m | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing a transferable classical force field (FF) historically constitutes a lengthy expert-informed process. In this work, we integrate optimization, machine learning, and data science techniques to accelerate the systematic design and parameterization of transferable FF models. As a demonstration, we create transferable FF models for one and two-carbon hydrofluorocarbons to accurately model diverse thermophysical properties including liquid density, vapor density, vapor pressure, and enthalpy of vaporization. Estimability analysis and eigen-decomposition of the Fisher information matrix inform the structure of the of final FF model. This model obtains an average mean absolute percent deviation (MAPD) between 2.92% (liquid density) and 31.5% (vapor density) on molecules not considered in the training set. This model (MAPD = 18.37%) also achieves a lower overall MAPD than an optimized version of the general AMBER FF (MAPD = 19.95%). Gaussian process surrogate models reduce the evaluation time associated with model selection and optimization from an order of days to seconds. Thus, our results suggest that these systematic techniques are more effective than traditional FF design methods.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Machine Learning to Optimize Transferable Hydrofluorocarbon Refrigerant Force Field", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ffbc3aa482cba1225bec55/original/supporting-information-machine-learning-to-optimize-transferable-hydrofluorocarbon-refrigerant-force-field.pdf"}]</p></details> |
| **[Machine-Learning Adaptivity, DFT-Level Accuracy, and Semi-Empirical Quantum-Chemistry Speed with Neural-Network Extended Tight-Binding](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69004d34113cc7cfff7de942/original/machine-learning-adaptivity-dft-level-accuracy-and-semi-empirical-quantum-chemistry-speed-with-neural-network-extended-tight-binding.pdf)** | 2025-10-30 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-chlcc | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast, general, and interpretable quantum accuracy remains elusive for large, complex molecules. Here we introduce NN-xTB, a Hamiltonian-preserving framework that augments the explicit GFN2-xTB operator with small, bounded, environment-dependent shifts to a compact set of physically named parameters predicted by an E(3)-equivariant encoder. By confining learning to on-site/shell terms, hardness and its charge derivative, overlap/hopping scalings, anisotropic electrostatics/XC prefactors, short-range exchange, and selected global factors, NN-xTB restores local chemical sensitivity while retaining analytic long-range limits, native charge/spin treatment, and a self-consistent (SCF) solution---so all observables arise from the same adapted electronic state.  
Across complementary benchmarks, NN-xTB attains DFT-like accuracy at near–xTB cost: on GMTKN55 it reaches a WTMAD-2 of 5.58 kcal/mol (versus 25.0 kcal/mol for GFN2-xTB, and 9.3 kcal/mol for g-xTB), achieves the lowest force MAE on 8/10 rMD17 molecules and 10–40% RMSE reductions on large MACEOFF23/SPICE subsets against strong equivariant MLIPs, and cuts VQM24 frequency MAE from 200.6 to 12.7 cm^(-1) (>90\% reduction). Under temperature shift (3BPA), errors remain markedly lower up to 1200 K.  The neural-network component in NN-xTB adds <20% wall-time overhead, preserving the throughput that motivates semi-empirical quantum methods.   
Overall, NN-xTB demonstrates that targeted, Hamiltonian-level adaptation can bridge much of the gap to DFT while keeping interpretability, asymptotics, and robustness, offering a practical, GPU-ready path to quantum-accurate molecular simulation and design at scale.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Quantum Mechanics | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "pplementary Information: Machine-Learning Adaptivity, DFT-Level Accuracy, and Semi-Empirical Quantum-Chemistry Speed with Neural-Network Extended Tight-Binding", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69005034113cc7cfff7e2346/original/pplementary-information-machine-learning-adaptivity-dft-level-accuracy-and-semi-empirical-quantum-chemistry-speed-with-neural-network-extended-tight-binding.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The binding between supramolecular hosts and their desired guests are governed by the same forces that drive protein-small molecule interactions, and yet this field has seen dramatically less application of machine learning. In this contribution, we demonstrate that the production of easily diversified building blocks can allow a single laboratory to generate a dataset that is sufficient to engage with modern machine learning approaches. A range of methods were evaluated against our single-laboratory dataset, with a graph neural network featuring an attention mechanism providing meaningful performance in this data-sparse arena.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Physical Organic Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry (Org.); Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68fff3c6a482cba1226515ed/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here we present an integrated molecular dynamics/coordinate driving-active learning (MD/CD-AL) framework that efficiently samples diverse reactive configurations to construct MDCD20, a curated dataset of ~1.4 million H/C/N/O structures with radical species covered. Trained on MDCD20, the resulting MDCD-NN MLP achieves quantum-mechanical accuracy in reaction pathway predictions, matching or surpassing existing MLPs trained on much larger datasets. Tests across 181 widespread types of elementary reactions confirm excellent transferability. Leveraging MD/CD-driven automatic searching, MDCD-NN serves as an effective tool for constructing reaction networks with a 104-fold speedup relative to its reference density functional theory calculations. Its capacity could be demonstrated by rationalizing and extending experimentally established mechanisms in three real-world reactions, tackling complex scenarios such as multiple reaction centers, large conformational spaces, enantioselectivity. MDCD-NN also supports nanosecond-scale dynamics to map reactive free-energy landscapes. This work establishes a data-efficient paradigm for building reactive MLPs, enabling high-throughput mechanistic exploration in chemically complex reactions.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6900d4b7113cc7cfff947e38/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The performance of the metal hydride based systems is strongly governed by the thermodynamics of metal-hydrogen interactions. Among key thermodynamic properties, the equilibrium plateau pressure (Peq ) is particularly critical, as it defines the conditions under which hydrogen absorption and desorption occur, directly influencing operating conditions of the system. Traditionally, determination of P eq requires extensive experimental measurements, limiting the pace of materials discovery. In this work, we introduce EquiP, a machine learning framework designed to predict P eq as a function of temperature. Beyond single-point predictions, EquiP generates complete Van’t Hoff plots (Peq vs. 1/T), enabling rapid determination of enthalpy (∆H) and entropy (∆S) of hydride formation. We further show that incorporating structural descriptors derived from X- ray diffraction (XRD) data enhances performance of the model, with sparse training datasets. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the extended feature set improves predictive accuracy and generalizes well to unseen hydride compositions. This work demonstrates that with lim- ited data, intelligent feature design grounded in domain knowledge is the key to improving predictions of complex material properties.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Alloys; Hydrogen Storage Materials; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: What drives property prediction for solid-state hydrogen storage?

By integrating classic functional forms for the excess Gibbs free energy into our model structure, the trained model enforces the Gibbs-Duhem relation on all model outputs, ensuring physically realistic predictions. The model simultaneously predicts component vapor pressures, enabling direct training on experimental composition data rather than inferred activity coefficients. Given molecule SMILES representations, liquid-phase composition, and temperature data as inputs, the model can predict vapor phase compositions and pressure. Comparisons to alternative activity coefficient predictors, the UNIFAC group additivity method and the HANNA machine-learning model, show superior performance by EquiNet across a broad spectrum of binary mixtures. Our results further highlight the value of incorporating the extended dataset made accessible through the model’s internal vapor pressure prediction module, enabling broader applicability and higher accuracy. Finally, we share predictions on a public benchmark dataset for vapor-liquid equilibrium compositions, providing a foundation for further development and transparent evaluation of machine-learning approaches in thermodynamic modeling.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Chem.

LDH-VacGenie consists of four key modules: LDH-VacPredictor for performance prediction, SynthFlow-LLM for synthesis pathway generation, VacancyGen-Optimizer for efficient design exploration, and VacInterpret-Engine for explainable analysis of vacancy effects. Experiments show that LDH-VacGenie achieves high prediction accuracy, strong generalization, and significant acceleration in catalyst discovery. It identifies novel, synthesizable candidates with superior OER performance and provides atomic-level insights into vacancy–metal interactions.

In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, the use of an accurate and efficient machine learning-based approach for atomistic modeling of host-guest interactions in large-scale PLs. The approach uses E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) to construct a machine learning interatomic potential and a nuclear magnetic resonance machine learning model. The former enables machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations, while the latter computes 129Xe isotropic chemical shift, δiso, from MLMD snapshots. Applied to a PL composed of CC3-R POC in 4-(trifluoromethoxy)benzyl alcohol (TBA) solvent loaded with high Xe concentration, this dual-model approach shows that host(CC3)–guest(Xe) interactions are best described by a three-site binding model comprising the CC3 cavity, CC3 openings, and TBA, with exchange events occurring between these sites. Good agreement between computed and experimental 129Xe δiso validates our approach, demonstrating EGNN-based simulations as transformative tools for advancing PL understanding.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information for \"Equivariant Neural Networks Reveal How Host\u2013Guest Interactions Shape 129Xe NMR in Porous Liquids\"", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68fbc1f1aec32c6568f58fd8/original/supporting-information-for-equivariant-neural-networks-reveal-how-host-guest-interactions-shape-129xe-nmr-in-porous-liquids.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, the structural and dynamical complexity of battery materials limits the unambiguous interpretation of experimental data. Fast ionic motion can partially average experimentally observable quantities, leaving the underlying distribution of electric field gradients (EFGs) experimentally inaccessible and thus the measured data hard to interpret. In contrast, atomic simulation approaches, while providing the structure–observable relationship, are often constrained to idealized models. Established methods such as density functional theory (DFT) remain computationally expensive for realistic time and length scales. Here, we show how experimental complexity in the fast-ion conductor Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) can be approached via a machine-learning (ML) assisted workflow. ML acceleration enables microsecond-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and efficient predictions of EFG tensors via a tensorial model. By time averaging the EFG tensors from the MD trajectory, we compute the temperature dependence of 7Li NMR quadrupolar observables subject to motional narrowing. Our prediction of the quadrupolar coupling of 24 kHz for tetragonal LGPS is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 23 kHz. Furthermore, we emulate a spin-alignment echo (SAE) experiment in silico and apply the inverse Laplace transform (ILT) to extract correlation times for ionic motion of Li in different LGPS crystal structures. Finally, we assess whether SAE can differentiate inter-grain versus intra-grain ion dynamics via the orientational dependence of the EFG tensor.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68fb6f093e6156d3bec11f4b/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

These MLPs are typically trained on quantum chemical data obtained from traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that predominantly sample near-equilibrium configurations. This often limits the model’s ability to describe high-energy, off-equilibrium states required to study rare events. To address this capability gap, we introduce a novel active learning curriculum using the On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) method. Using imidazole diffusion in the SALEM-2 metal-organic framework (MOF) as a prototypical example, we apply time-dependent OPES biases with temperature- and distance-based collective variables to systematically sample the most relevant regions of the potential energy surface. This strategy enables nanosecond-scale MD simulations with near-DFT accuracy, capturing both the expected diffusion pathway across the 6-membered window and a previously unreported ring-opening mechanism through the more constrained 4-membered window. The latter process, which involves the transient dissociation of a Zn–N bond, cannot be captured using classical force fields and is prohibitively expensive with DFT. Thus, this study highlights how enhanced sampling methods can overcome data scarcity challenges associated with training MLPs for studying rare events in nanoporous materials. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Modeling Diffusion in Metal-Organic Frameworks using On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling-based Machine Learning Potentials", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68fad5c85dd091524f240343/original/supporting-information-modeling-diffusion-in-metal-organic-frameworks-using-on-the-fly-probability-enhanced-sampling-based-machine-learning-potentials.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Our approach applies Savitzky–Golay smoothing to per-frame thermodynamic traces (potential energy in NVE/NVT or enthalpy in NPT ensembles), to identify local extrema as proxies for minima and transition states, and generates the necessary files for disconnectivity graph construction. This workflow requires no additional geometry optimisation. The method is ensemble-agnostic and compatible with both all-atom and coarse-grained simulations.

The resulting graphs capture the structures that are visited and pathways between them only for a selected energy and time resolution, offering an interpretable structural summary of conformational hierarchies with minimal preprocessing.

However, the previous AIQM1 and AIQM2 models are limited to molecular systems with four elements: H, C, N, and O, which falls short of meeting the common needs for atomistic simulations. Here, we introduce the extension—AIQM3—that covers three additional chemical elements: S, F, Cl, and approaches coupled cluster level at the speed of a semi-empirical method. AIQM3 maintains the accuracy of its predecessor AIQM2, surpasses the commonly used density functional theory (DFT) method in different types of molecular interactions, and its efficiency is competitive with that of machine learning interatomic potentials on commodity CPU hardware. AIQM3 superiority is showcased for reaction simulations and tasks related to drug design, where it delivers accurate torsion profiles for various real-world drug-like molecules. In addition, AIQM3 can be used for infrared (IR) spectra calculations at a low cost. We provide a web service for the AIQM3 calculations on the Aitomistic Hub at aitomistic.xyz, to democratize and facilitate its use with the assistance of AI agents.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

This approach paves the way toward a new class of approximations within Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT). However, since all existing Quantum Theory Project (QTP) functionals are derived from CAM-B3LYP, we pose the question: Can COT improve the hybrid versions of different exchange-correlation (XC) functionals as well? To that end, we explore two optimization strategies for adjusting the existing parameters within PBE0, TPSS0, and LC-PBE0: i) the ionization potential (IP) condition and ii) the HOMO–LUMO condition. In this sense, we critically assess how these functionals address the "Devil's Triangle" of KS-DFT: self-interaction error, integer discontinuity, and one-particle spectra. We further examine how the COT influences the description of two challenging properties, charge transfer and reaction barrier heights. Overall, enforcing both COT conditions systematically enhances the performance of functionals within the PBE family, although the description of reaction barriers still leaves room for improvement.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6900d731a482cba1228375e4/original/supplementary-material.pdf"}]</p></details> |

We recently found that a nitrile’s (–C≡N) infrared (IR) transition dipole moment (TDM) and anomalous hydrogen-bond (H-bond) blueshift can report on its environmental electric field and H-bond geometry and dynamics, respectively. Here, we expand on prior work with nitriles site-selectively incorporated into photoactive yellow protein by engineering local interactions, in particular putative H-bonds, using site-directed mutagenesis. A comprehensive analysis combining IR data, high-resolution X-ray crystal structures, and extensive simulations demonstrate that the polarizable AMOEBA force field is needed to adequately interpret the data and can provide accurate information on both the kinetics and thermodynamics of local electrostatic interactions. This is achieved by correlating experimentally and computationally derived nitrile electric fields due to noncovalent interactions as well as H-bond blueshifts from different apparent H-bond fluctuation timescales. We conclude by discussing the experimental and computational advances that enabled this study and the future opportunities they afford, such as benchmarking molecular dynamics force fields that include higher level description of molecular electrostatics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Biophysical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69014caba482cba122960242/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here we propose the Magnetic Response Orbital Theory (MROT) through inspecting the asymptotic behavior of molecular orbitals under infinitesimal magnetic field, which allows easy understanding, analyses, determinations and predictions for every possible type of aromaticity using Magnetic Response Orbitals (MROs). Based on this theory, we conclude that the magnetic aromaticity and antiaromaticity are only properties derived from the magnetic perturbations on molecular orbitals suitable to generate MROs with angular momenta, and there are no cause-and-effect relationships between magnetic aromaticity and stability. Till then, the twin property of aromaticity and antiaromaticity could be deciphered uniformly by one theory.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Material", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69003880113cc7cfff7c325f/original/supplementary-material.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Whilst the pernicious effect of basis set superposition error (BSSE) on many-body expansion has been known for some time, this effect has received less attention in recent work. In this study, we demonstrate that BSSE can play a very significant role accounting for more than 50% of the MBE errors that were previously attributed to self-interaction error. We focus on the same ion-water clusters examined in recent studies and further demonstrate that when effects of BSSE and DFT integration grid are minimized, charge embedding can be an effective strategy for mitigating self-interaction error to restore the convergent behaviour of many-body expansion. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Despite the apparent simplicity of the symmetric HO--C=C--C=O ESIHT prototype, its multifunctional nature enables competing non-radiative decay channels, including C=C torsional motion.  Here, we compare malonaldehyde (MA), the minimal motif, with its methylated derivative acetylacetone (AcAc) to investigate how electronic and inertial effects of methylation shape the ultrafast dynamics initiated on S2(pp*). XMS-CASPT2 non-adiabatic dynamics on the singlet manifold reveal bond-length alternation  that drives the wavepacket toward the H-transfer intersection seam rather than undergoing torsional motion directly out of the Franck--Condon region.   Methylation destabilizes the S1(np*) state, reducing the S2/S1-energy gap and enhancing the asymmetry of the H-transfer intersection seam. As a result, S2/S1-decay precedes H-transfer, which mostly takes place only after the population arrives on S1. Moreover, the methyl groups in AcAc introduce an inertial mismatch between the central methine hydrogen and the terminal methyl groups, which gives rise to two distinct behaviors on S1: (i) an early ballistic rise in ground-state population within ~75 fs via twist-pyramidalized geometries akin to the behavior of alpha, beta-enones; and (ii) a slower repopulation through torsional motion, with the majority of the population remaining near the planar S1-minimum. In contrast, MA displays no ballistic channel. Our results for AcAc are consistent with recent time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy confirming the ultrafast S2-lifetime. We propose extending such experiments into the X-ray regime, where the evolution of the oxygen 1s binding energies offer direct, site-specific sensitivity to the H-transfer mediated motion governing the early decay.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Electronic and Inertial Effects of Methylation on Excited-State Hydrogen Transfer", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68fe35205dd091524fa6abfe/original/supporting-information-electronic-and-inertial-effects-of-methylation-on-excited-state-hydrogen-transfer.pdf"}]</p></details> |

In this study, we report cell-surface-reactive, polyfluoroalkyl-tagged polyarginine peptides as CPP-additives with varying fluorine content, which enhances cytosolic protein delivery in living cells. We observed that CPP-additives containing 11 13 fluorine atoms significantly enhance intracellular protein delivery relative to a tagless control (> 2-fold) at low micromolar concentrations (2.5 µM) without observable cytotoxicity. Live-cell time-lapse fluorescence imaging revealed that a CPP-additive with 13 fluorine atoms exhibited prolonged membrane association relative to a tagless control (> 5 minutes) and facilitated rapid protein internalization within 10 minutes. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) measurements with POPC model membranes indicated that polyfluoroalkylation overall strengthens CPP-additive lipid bilayer interactions. Notably, we found that while fluorous CPP-additives initially interacted with the lipid bilayer predominantly as aggregates, they subsequently inserted into the membrane interior as individual molecules without fluorous tag-tag association. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations of the initial membrane association step provided atomistic insights into these monomeric fluoroalkyl-mediated lipid interactions, revealing partial lipid insertion of an arginine-containing CPP-additive with 13 fluorine atoms while no insertion was observed for a non-fluorinated control at the same time scale.  Collectively, our findings introduce polyfluoroalkyl-tagged CPP-additives as potent, non-cytotoxic vectors for intracellular protein delivery and provide mechanistic insights into their monomeric CPP-additive-lipid bilayer interactions.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Theory - Computational; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information ", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68fb9545aec32c6568eaafab/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Compared to the global hybrid density functionals PBE0, TPSSh, and B3LYP, the local hybrid density functional LH20t offers significantly improved agreement with experiment. In some cases, structural flexibility leads to significant uncertainties, which can be addressed with conformer-rotamer sampling as demonstrated for an Fe(II) porphyrin complex.

An absolute binding affinity is the natural quantitative descriptor for such interactions, but has not been directly accessible. Erwinia ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC) is a lipid-sensitive model for the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel protein family. ELIC is sensitive to palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) in model membranes, and densities from cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) resemble ordered phospholipids near the protein-membrane interface. Here, we present precise binding affinities for occupancy of this density by POPG, using an atomistic implementation of our Streamlined Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation (SAFEP) method. Achieving convergence required computationally inexpensive collective variables that were robust to the flexibility of phospholipids. POPG shows weak non-ideality in a binary POPC:POPG membrane, with excess chemical potentials that are slightly weaker for 10-30% POPG. Non-ideality in the bulk membrane negligibly affects predicted binding, due to the strong binding affinity (-9.7+/-0.8 kcal/mol). These results align with previous binding free energy estimates and show robust convergence across several metrics. They are also consistent with the strong non-bonded interactions between POPG and the protein, not observed with POPC. This affinity quantifies the equilibrium binding of the glycerol backbone, a necessary but insufficient condition for modulation. Unbiased simulations reveal that when the backbone is bound, the headgroup can adopt at least two distinct conformations, each interacting with protein residues with established functional implications.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Biophysics; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

The framework defines the excitation number and the relaxation number, which quantify electron promotion and electron relaxation. Formulated in terms of difference density natural orbitals (DDNOs), the approach generalizes earlier attachment/detachment and natural ionization orbital models. A compact set of modified Slater-Condon rules derived in the DDNO basis enables direct evaluation of transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths. Application to a test set of 5 molecules and nineteen ΔSCF excitations demonstrates that the model yields integer excitation numbers and interpretable relaxation numbers, and that the corresponding DDNOs can be visualized to display particle/hole and relaxation pairs.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information File", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68fa6bb33e6156d3be97551b/original/supporting-information-file.pdf"}]</p></details> |
