Here we extend these classical descriptors from static ambient values to pressure-dependent response functions spanning 0–300 GPa, testing whether the dynamic behaviour of atomic properties under compression contains predictive information for binary alloy mixing absent from single-point evaluation.
Using 780 binary pairs from 40 elements with mixing enthalpies from the DFT calculations and pressure-dependent atomic data from the SHARC database, we constructed 83 features: 13 ambient-only (classical Hume–Rothery baseline) and 70 pressure-dependent (gradients, variabilities, and trajectory stabilities). Statistical hypothesis testing demonstrates that pressure-dependent features improve prediction of the mixing enthalpy sign by Δ = +11.5% over ambient-only descriptors (p = 0.0001, Cohen's d = 2.69).
Pipeline-aware SHAP analysis attributes 84.6 ± 0.1% of predictive contribution to pressure-dependent features across three independent runs. The dominant descriptors—electronegativity variability and gradient under compression—directly extend the classical electronegativity-mismatch criterion: favourable mixing correlates not merely with small ambient Δχ, but with electronegativity trajectories that preserve electronic compatibility across the pressure domain. Similarly, atomic radius gradients extend the 15% size-mismatch rule by capturing differential compressibility. External validation on 29 lanthanum-containing pairs not included in training achieved 80% accuracy.
These results establish that the logic of Hume–Rothery—evaluating atomic compatibility to predict mixing—gains substantial predictive power when extended from single ambient values to pressure-response trajectories.

Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) tools automate this process by recursively proposing immediate precursors of molecules to identify multistep synthetic pathways. However, the application of CASP tools becomes particularly challenging for complex molecules due to the increased length of synthetic pathways and the increased number of possible disconnections. We introduce a new framework for computer-aided retrosynthesis, \emph{higher-level} retrosynthesis, that focuses on the broader retrosynthetic strategy. We abstract the detailed substructures in the intermediates of a synthetic pathway that do not appear in the target product, allowing our algorithm to emphasize the general, higher-level strategies and postpone the consideration of chemically-equivalent functional groups to a later stage. This approach leads to shorter and narrower search trees, letting the search algorithm allocate its computational resources more efficiently and discover retrosynthetic strategies that the original approach does not generate. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach with higher success rates in single- and multi-step retrosynthetic planning. We further underscore the value of our framework through case studies involving complex drugs and natural products. We illustrate how the strategies identified through our framework provide chemists with a powerful basis to develop full synthesis plans, particularly in challenging cases where the original approach to computer-aided retrosynthesis trained on the same dataset yields no viable solutions, while also enabling them to leverage their expertise and intuition to refine the synthesis design process. Ultimately, focusing on higher-level strategies in computer-aided retrosynthesis enhances its effectiveness and enables a more intuitive approach to addressing challenging retrosynthesis problems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/693c32bbbc44e47cf423f598/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Higher education should respond not by banning these tools, but by integrating them in ways that preserve deep learning, build student agency, and reflect professional practice. This article offers a practical framework for faculty who want students to use AI to write code in STEM courses ranging from lab courses with analysis and data visualization components, to disciplines transitioning from tools like Excel or SPSS to scalable open-source Python workflows. These insights are grounded in 10+ years of research experience in AI applications in physical chemistry and biophysics, and 5+ years of experience teaching both a Python-based data analysis course for chemistry majors and a technical communication course for chemists where AI tools were used to support student learning and skill development. Key recommendations include pairing AI-assisted, project-based learning with one-on-one, code-review-style oral exams during which students must be able to explain every line of their code, and ensuring that students achieve conceptual mastery of core programming principles that can be overlooked when relying on AI code generation (e.g. data types of variables, inputs, and outputs, principled use of methods and attributes from Python objects, et cetera). These strategies aim to prevent cognitive offloading of essential conceptual knowledge, which is a significant risk associated with "vibe coding," where students rely on AI to generate code without understanding it themselves, while still enabling students to build domain-specific AI fluency required in an increasingly AI-driven economy.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Chemical Education; Chemical Education - General; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Within chemistry, a field characterized by its rich and diverse data modalities---ranging from visual representations of molecules and materials to intricate spectroscopic signals and verbose experimental descriptions---the potential impact is profound. Traditional approaches often struggle with the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of chemical data, requiring specialized expertise for each modality. However, advanced AI paradigms, capable of seamlessly integrating and reasoning across these disparate data types, offer a pathway to overcome these limitations. This survey provides an in-depth exploration of the state-of-the-art in VLMs and multimodal models, focusing on their application, adaptation, and future potential within chemical analysis. We begin by establishing the fundamental concepts of both chemical data modalities and multimodal AI architectures. We then systematically review current VLM frameworks and their specialized adaptations for chemical contexts, followed by an examination of broader multimodal models that transcend simple vision-language pairings. A dedicated section categorizes and discusses diverse applications across materials discovery, reaction prediction, and drug discovery, highlighting how these AI systems enhance accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. Finally, we critically assess the prevailing challenges, outline promising future research directions, and consider the ethical implications pertinent to deploying powerful AI in chemical science. By consolidating existing knowledge and identifying key research gaps, this survey aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers at the interdisciplinary nexus of AI and chemistry, fostering innovation in this rapidly expanding field.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Here, we introduce FeNNix-Bio1, a foundation machine learning model designed to power accurate, reactive atomistic simulations of biological systems at an unprecedented speed and scalability. Trained exclusively on synthetic quantum chemistry data, FeNNix-Bio1 accurately captures complex condensed-phase phenomena such as ion solvation and subtle liquid water properties for which it outperforms state-of-the-art specialized force fields. We demonstrate its versatility across a full spectrum of drug design applications, including the calculation of hydration free energies (HFEs), the reversible folding of small proteins, the simulation of protein-ligand absolute binding free energies and chemical reactions. Notably, FeNNix-Bio1 sets a new standard for the precise prediction of HFEs for the more than 600 molecules of the Freesolv dataset, providing sub-kcal/mol accuracy.  By enabling scalable, quantum-accurate molecular dynamics without the need for manual parametrization, FeNNix-Bio1 bridges the gap between static structure prediction and dynamic biological reality: it is likely to have a strong impact in Drug Design.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information for: A Foundation Model for Accurate Atomistic Simulations in Drug Design", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69399703bc44e47cf4980c5c/original/supplementary-information-for-a-foundation-model-for-accurate-atomistic-simulations-in-drug-design.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Herein we propose a data augmentation approach to generate a balanced dataset of fictive reactions. First, we apply retrosynthesis templates to template-matched USPTO molecules used as products (P) to obtain starting materials (SM). We then use transformer T2 from our recently reported triple transformer loop (TTL) retrosynthesis model to predict reagents (R). Finally, we validate the resulting fictive reaction by requesting high confidence, correct prediction by transformer T3*, trained to predict P from R and SM* with tagged reacting atoms. We generate up to 5,000 reactions per template, resulting in a template-equilibrated dataset of 27.5 million fictive reactions covering the chemical space of the original UPSTO dataset. We demonstrate that a TTL trained on these fictive reactions outperforms a TTL trained on USPTO reactions only. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

We present a Gradient-Enhanced Genetic Algorithm (GE-GA) for the global optimization of adsorbate–surface configurations, combining genetic exploration with periodic local geometry relaxation. The adsorbate is treated as a fully flexible entity via a continuous genome encoding translational, rotational, and torsional degrees of freedom. GE-GA integrates with a machine-learned interatomic potential (MatterSim) to accelerate energy and force evaluations. We benchmark the method against standard Genetic Algorithm and Minima Hopping approaches on four systems of increasing complexity: aspartic acid on Cu(111), CO on Pt(111), glutamic acid on Au(111), and ethylene on a Pt/O-decorated CuO(111) surface. For all cases, GE-GA consistently locates lower or equal energy structures with significantly fewer evaluations, being able to provide the global minima in less than 20 minutes, using a regular desktop computer. We also provide an open-source implementation, GOAD, built on the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), with both a Python API and a graphical interface for practical adoption in surface chemistry and catalysis workflows. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Gradient-Enhanced Genetic Algorithm for Global optimization of Mo- lecular Adsorption on Metal Surfaces", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/693b4d44bc44e47cf4f90b84/original/gradient-enhanced-genetic-algorithm-for-global-optimization-of-mo-lecular-adsorption-on-metal-surfaces.pdf"}]</p></details> |

While machine learning (ML) models offer a promising alternative, they have predominantly relied on separate feature representations for the enzyme and substrate, lacking explicit information about their interaction interface. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that explicitly incorporates enzyme-substrate interface information by encoding the enzyme’s active site as a feature. Using a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a gated layer, we demonstrate that this explicit active site information enables our model, Active Site for Km (AS4Km), to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the independent HXKm test set, rivaling more complex architectures. Ablation studies confirm that active site features significantly enhance generalization to unseen data. Furthermore, our analysis highlights a critical limitation in current enzymology databases: predictive performance is heavily reliant on substrate identity due to low substrate diversity and a bias towards active enzyme-substrate complexes. Our results show that AS4Km, a data-driven approach combined with explicit interaction interface features, displays competitive performance in the prediction of Km values for enzyme-substrate complexes, and may be able to assist in the identification of novel substrates for known enzymes.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/693aa78eef27c95d3b18ceac/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Recently, machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are approaching the accuracy of ab initio methods at speeds closer to traditional force fields by training on large datasets of ab initio results. Some datasets include atomic partial charges, which are convenient for training models with explicit charge assignments. We propose adding diversity to the training data by perturbing atomic charge, and annotating atoms with corresponding energy derivatives. These additional atom-level labels are identical to electronegativity as defined in conceptual density functional theory. To demonstrate this proposal, we construct a training dataset of crystals with two-atom unit cells, controlling the charge transfer between the atoms by imposing an external potential. By matching the form of the potential to the charge partitioning scheme, we compute the electronegativity difference from the strength of the imposed potential, and observe a near-linear relationship with charge transfer. Fitting these electronegativity differences with linear regression yields the parameters of a charge equilibration model. Our results demonstrate a new way of training charge prediction models, and show how to diversify MLIP training datasets while simultaneously adding atom-level response properties that can be used as training targets.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6939f2e1bc44e47cf4a77638/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here we introduce j-IR-vis, a vision-based neural model that learns chemically interpretable representations directly from IR spectra for functional-group prediction and downstream molecular characterization. Trained separately on simulated ($\D_{sim}$) and experimental ($\D_{exp}$) datasets, j-IR-vis achieves strong functional group classification accuracy, with Exact-Match Ratios of 0.77–0.81 on $\Dsim$ and 0.67–0.76 on $\D_{exp}$, and Macro-F$_1$ scores up to 0.93. Grad-CAM attention maps reveal that the model consistently focuses on the fingerprint region (1500–400 cm$^{-1}$), confirming that it leverages physically meaningful vibrational features. Embedding-space analyses show that inclusion of this region improves all geometric metrics—RankMe, Silhouette, Separation, and Lift—indicating a richer and more structured latent manifold. Fixed embeddings further enable accurate prediction of aromatic ring counts (weighted F$_1$ = 0.69) and octanol–water partition coefficients ($\mathrm{RMSE}=1.18$, Spearman’s $\rho=0.59$), demonstrating transferability to structural and physicochemical tasks without retraining the vision backbone. Finally, cosine-similarity analyses reveal that j-IR-vis captures complementary chemical relationships compared to traditional fingerprint-based representations. Finally, cosine-similarity analyses reveal that j-IR-vis embeds molecules in a spectroscopically informed similarity space that captures relationships not present in standard fingerprint representations. Together, these results establish j-IR-vis as a general-purpose spectral encoder that bridges experimental spectroscopy and molecular machine learning, offering a physically grounded route to multi-modal chemical representations. j-IR-vis is openly accessible through the GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/ChemAI-Lab/jirvis}. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Existing deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but often lack mechanistic interpretability, while mechanistic rule-based frameworks offer interpretability but limited predictive breadth. To bridge this divide, we developed a mechanism-aware deep learning framework that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) structural encodings with biologically curated mechanistic pathway features to predict toxicity across five clinically relevant endpoints: hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, mitochondrial toxicity, and hERG/QT risk.  A curated dataset of 50 mechanistically diverse compounds was assembled to evaluate the model. The GNN component learns atom-level and bond-level representations from molecular graphs, while mechanistic features encode known biological drivers of toxicity such as CYP-mediated bioactivation, mitochondrial disruption, transporter interactions, electrophilicity, and hERG binding risk. The hybrid model jointly performs binary organ-specific toxicity classification and continuous toxicity-severity regression.  Training curves demonstrated stable learning dynamics, with toxicity classification loss decreasing from ~0.69 to ~0.30 and severity regression loss decreasing from >2.0 to <0.40 over 50 epochs. Organ-specific validation AUROC values were high for hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, mitochondrial toxicity, and hERG/QT risk (typically 0.85–1.00), with nephrotoxicity showing lower but biologically consistent performance due to pathway heterogeneity. Model explainability was assessed using atom-level importance maps and mechanism-level attribution. Acetaminophen exhibited strong contributions from CYP2E1 bioactivation and reactive metabolite formation, faithfully recapitulating its known toxicity mechanism. In contrast, cisplatin nephrotoxicity was driven primarily by structural GNN features rather than pathway flags, consistent with the drug’s mechanism (Pt(II)-mediated DNA crosslinking and proximal tubule accumulation).  Across the dataset, the model produced intuitive and biologically grounded mechanistic attributions while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. Toxicity profiles highlighted clear clustering patterns, including mitochondrial disruptors (e.g., doxorubicin, isoniazid), hERG-risk compounds (e.g., cisapride), and strong hepatotoxins (e.g., valproate, diclofenac). This integration of structure-level deep learning and biology-based mechanistic features enables high-performance prediction while preserving interpretability necessary for risk assessment, drug design, and regulatory decision-making.  This study demonstrates that mechanism-aware deep learning is a promising direction for translational toxicology, offering improved organ-specific prediction, mechanistic transparency, and practical utility. The framework is extensible to larger datasets, additional endpoints, and real-world drug discovery pipelines, positioning it as a viable foundation for next-generation computational safety evaluation.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Our approach combines GPU-accelerated crystal structure generation, active learning-guided model refinement, and quasi-harmonic free-energy corrections. The workflow successfully reproduces the experimental energy hierarchy of known polymorphs and identifies several novel low-energy structures with distinct packing motifs. In addition, we evaluate the elastic properties and thermal expansion effects across polymorphs, revealing structural features that underpin mechanical flexibility and thermodynamic preferences.

However, most BO frameworks rely on the knowledge of a few key physical parameters (features) correlated with the materials property of interest. This is a challenge in heterogeneous catalysis, where the material properties are governed by an intricate interplay of multiple physical processes, and the mentioned parameters are typically unknown. Here, we introduce the Sparse Adaptive Representation–based Bayesian Optimization (SARBO) framework that utilizes the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) symbolic-regression method for on-the-fly selection of key physical parameters correlated with materials properties during BO. Crucially, SISSO takes into account nonlinear relationships and interactions between multiple parameters when selecting key features. We demonstrate that SARBO enables efficient navigation of the materials spaces and outperforms widely used feature-selection approaches for the simulated discovery of single- and dual-atom alloy surface sites capable of activating CO2, a critical step in the CO2 reduction reaction.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6939811aef27c95d3bea1497/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Machine learning models promise to accelerate reaction optimization, yet systematic benchmarking across different catalytic systems remains limited. Here, we develop and validate a comprehensive machine learning framework for predicting reaction yields across five metal catalysts (Pd, Ni, Ru, Fe, Cu) using a dataset of 5,760 reactions modeled on high-throughput experimentation platforms. Our XGBoost model achieves R² = 0.903 (RMSE = 6.10%), substantially outperforming transformer-based YieldBERT (R² = 0.81, RMSE = 11%) while approaching graph neural network performance with dramatically lower computational costs. Importantly, systematic catalyst comparison reveals that nickel catalysis achieves superior performance (46.7% mean yield, 42% success rate) compared to conventional palladium (45.8% mean yield, 40% success rate), particularly for challenging chloride electrophiles.

Machine Learning force fields (MLFFs) offer a promising avenue to retain quantum mechanical accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost compared to ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Thus far, direct applications of ML force fields to FEP calculations lack systematic protocols and extensive benchmarking. In this work, we take a step in this direction by presenting a general and robust workflow for solvation (hydration) free energy (HFE) calculations which is independent of the details of the particular MLFF architecture used. Combining a broadly trained ML force field, Organic_MPNICE, with sufficient statistical and conformational sampling empowered by the solute-tempering technique, affords sub-kcal/mol average errors in HFE predictions relative to experimental estimates.  This approach outperforms state-of-the-art classical force fields and DFT-based implicit solvation models on a diverse set of 59 organic molecules and provides a route to ab initio-quality HFE predictions, advancing the use of ML force fields in thermodynamic property prediction.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Physical and Chemical Properties | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6938add2ef27c95d3bcb0ab3/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Background: Pharmaceutical batch scheduling in multi-reactor configurations presents complex optimization challenges under operational uncertainty, yet limited research addresses how parallel processing capacity affects heuristic performance and predictive modeling.
Objectives: This study investigated scheduling strategies for a dual-reactor pharmaceutical batch plant producing three antibiotic products, addressing heuristic performance, machine learning predictability, key performance drivers, and underlying mechanisms.
Methods: A simulation-based dataset of 1,200 scenarios was generated across four heuristics (FIFO, SPT, LPT, BALANCED) and three uncertainty levels. Analyses included two-way ANOVA, machine learning classification and regression, and structural equation modeling.
Results: Heuristic selection dominated performance (η² = .503), with FIFO producing makespans 47% longer than alternatives (d = 1.40, p < .001), while SPT, LPT, and BALANCED achieved equivalent outcomes. Uncertainty showed smaller effects (η² = .064) with no interaction. Machine learning achieved 92.5% classification accuracy and R² = .907 for makespan regression. Heuristic strategy (34%) and Product C demand (35%) emerged as dominant predictors. Mediation analysis revealed workload imbalance fully mediated FIFO's inferior performance.
Conclusions: Multi-reactor scheduling critically depends on heuristic selection, with FIFO producing substantially inferior outcomes through workload imbalance. The equivalence of SPT, LPT, and BALANCED provides implementation flexibility, while machine learning enables accurate prospective performance prediction.

[J. Mater. Chem. C 13(2025)842] determined that B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)[LanL2DZ] was not a sufficient functional/basis set to describe the halogen binding between the iodine of the HIM monomer and bromine. In this study, we investigate the cause of the overly positive binding energy and propose other computational methods that give an accurate description, as well as investigating whether the consideration of Van Der Waals forces using Grimme’s D3 empirical dispersion model is significant. Using models of the HIM-Br system and a representative anionic iodine monobromide (I-Br) model, it is determined that including D3 dispersion has no significant effect on the binding energy or bond length of the system. Additionally, the necessity of basis sets that consider effective core potentials (ECPs) for the accurate description of the HIM system is confirmed. It is found that while using a full B3LYP/def2 (either triple- or quad-zeta) computation is accurate, there are much smaller one-parameter hybrid functionals such as mPW1PW91/3-21G* that serve as a quick method for qualitative or screening analysis.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Physical and Chemical Properties | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

In this work, we use ML to enable nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations without access to the analytical energy gradients from the underlying electronic structure method.  By fine-tuning our foundational model for excited-states, OMNI-P2x, on energies alone, and leveraging automatic differentiability to obtain forces, we eliminate the gradient computation bottleneck that restricts calculations, such as NAMD, to methods with available analytical derivatives. Firstly, we validate the method on the benchmark system, fulvene, demonstrating that gradient-free ML potentials accurately reproduce NAMD populations and dynamics across multiple levels of theory: AIQM1/MRCI, CASSCF, and MRSF-TDDFT. This enables, for the first time, performing dynamics at the QD-NEVPT2 level, where analytical gradients remain unavailable. We further benchmark the protocol on cyclohexadiene photoinduced ring-opening, where gradient-free training on XMS-CASPT2 energies reproduces reference dynamics with high accuracy, and compare them to QD-NEVPT2 results. Finally, we apply the approach to trans-azobenzene, a prototypical molecular photoswitch, by performing fully dimensional simulations of its photoisomerization dynamics at the CASSCF and QD-NEVPT2 levels, establishing the highest-level excited-state simulations of this photoreaction to date.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Herein, the reaction involving the unsubstituted molecules- A1(R1 = H), A2(X = CH2), and A3 (R = Ph)- is considered the reference reaction. Generally, the study successfully establishes the reaction as kinetically controlled. Analysis of the reference reaction asserts the [4+2] step, in both the [4+2]/[3+2] and [3+2]/[4+2] tandem sequential cycloaddition reaction (TSCARs) sequences, as the rate determining step (rds).  The [4+2]/[3+2] TSCAR is found to be the overall most kinetically favored reaction sequence over its rival sequence to furnish the exo-cycloadduct as the major product. Most intriguingly, however, both the [3 + 2] step of the kinetically unfavored, and the [4 + 2] step of the kinetically favored reaction sequences are instrumental in determining the possible stereochemical outcome of the reaction in each respective sequence. Substituent study reveals that, generally, EDGs and SBGs maintain the observed trend for the reference reaction and increase the activation barriers. Conversely, EWGs generally reduce the activation barriers in the initial [4 + 2] steps of the kinetically favored reaction sequence to favor the formation of the exo-cycloadducts at the substituted and unsubstituted alkene functionality of the in-situ generated norbornadiene cycloadduct intermediate contrary to the comparatively increased barriers in the same step of the kinetically unfavored sequence. However, there are few exceptions to this trend. The high energies associated with the rds are attributed to the direction or manner of the mobility of electron density which is largely contributed by the substituents. Also, varying heteroatoms on the five-membered ring depict significant changes in the activation barrier heights and the stereoselectivity of the reaction, however the energetic trend is still maintained for all the five-membered heteroatomic derivatives relative to that of the reference reaction. Results from this work also probes into reviewing the so called “exo-rule” rendering it a suspect for failing to describe some systems of reactions, particularly, with the reaction from this study. Generally, the global and local reactivity indices complement the observed trends in the mechanism and selectivities of the titled reaction. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

In particular, the role of surface topography—pits, steps, wedges, and pores—in setting Thet has been recognized qualitatively but never quantified. Here, we develop a predictive framework using Classical Nucleation Theory to compute how wedge-like defects control Thet across ice-binding strengths and geome-tries. Confinement splits ice nucleation into two steps, with distinct barriers: nucleation inside the wedge (ΔGin) and growing ice out of the wedge into the surrounding liquid (ΔGout). We demonstrate that ΔGin depends on the angle of the wedge and the strength of binding of its walls to ice, while ΔGout depends only on temperature and the opening width, independent of wall chemistry. Mapping these barri-ers reveals a volcano-like trend: intermediate-strength nucleants (flat-surface nucleation temperature Tflat ≈ 244–260 K) gain the most from wedge defects (up to ~25 K), while weak nucleants are limited by ΔGin and strong ones by ΔGout. The steep temperature depend-ence of ΔGout renders potent nucleants insensitive to active-site density. Ice nucleation activity of wedges is strongly angle-selective, with only facet-matching wedge angles achieving maximal enhancement. We release ice-WEDGE, an open-source tool that predicts Thet , the limiting barrier, and nucleus geometry for arbitrary wedge geometry and ice-binding strength. This study supplies design rules for topog-raphies that promote or suppress freezing, enabling physically grounded interpretation and parameterization of atmospheric ice-nucleating particle spectra.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Atmospheric Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Interfaces | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/693c933208e316a05f29c3fa/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, SA-CASSCF suffers from one Achilles heel, related to the description of ionic ππ∗ excited states, whose energy is often overestimated by 1–2 eV. In light of this challenge, we present the XS-CASSCF method, a new approach based on the idea of exchange scaling (XS) that screens the involved energy terms to improve the excitation energies of singlet ionic ππ∗ states. First, we illustrate the power of the XS-CASSCF method using hexatriene and para-quinodimethane as examples, showing that it corrects the targeted ionic states while leaving the other states largely unaffected, with root-mean-square errors (RMSE) below 0.2 eV for the four lowest states in both cases. Subsequently, XS-CASSCF vertical excitation energies are tested against theoretical best estimates for a set of 11 molecules and 56 excited states. We highlight that XS-CASSCF performs exceptionally well for the ππ∗ states of hydrocarbons reducing the RMSE over 21 excitation energies from 0.96 to 0.27 eV. We also study a more challenging test set including molecules with heteroatoms and a larger number of ππ∗ and nπ∗ states, finding that improvements can be obtained also in this case, albeit not as pronounced. Owing to notable improvements across significant classes of molecules combined with its conceptual simplicity, we believe that XS-CASSCF will be a prominent tool in the electronic structure toolbox, serving both as a standalone electronic structure method and as a starting point for further correlated treatment.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Data", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/693bfb9f08e316a05ffa5ee9/original/supplementary-data.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Rigorous physics-based in silico approaches, particularly alchemical free energy methods, have become a gold standard tool for estimating compound affinity changes. Here we present the results of a large-scale pre-competitive collaborative assessment of relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations generated by 15 pharmaceutical companies. We evaluate an open-source and MIT licensed RBFE Protocol from the Open Free Energy (OpenFE) ecosystem across both public and blinded private datasets, encompassing over 1,700 ligands in total. For the public dataset, the weighted RMSE across the 58 systems was 1.73 [1.53, 1.96] kcal/mol, with 10 of the systems reaching sub-kcal/mol accuracy. For the private dataset, the weighted RMSE across the 37 systems was 2.44 [1.94, 3.06] kcal/mol, with only 2 of the systems reaching sub-kcal/mol accuracy, reflecting the increased complexity of real-world drug discovery.  The protocols performance was system-dependent, with no single dominant error source, indicating that accuracy is primarily influenced by input quality and transformation type. Overall, these benchmark results are encouraging and indicate that OpenFE is ready for large-scale industrial applications, with an "out-of-the-box" accuracy that approaches that of commercial solutions. While comparison against published FEP+ results, which were obtained after manual parameter optimization, shows comparable ranking statistics, a gap remains in error statistics, for which we outline possible paths toward improvement. The protocol meets key criteria required for production use in an industrial setting: it shows robust performance, generates reproducible results, and achieves both sufficient throughput and rapid convergence.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Large-scale collaborative assessment of binding free energy calculations for drug discovery using OpenFE", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/693adaa308e316a05fc0022c/original/supporting-information-large-scale-collaborative-assessment-of-binding-free-energy-calculations-for-drug-discovery-using-open-fe.pdf"}]</p></details> |

We aim to simulate experimentally measured linear transmission spectroscopy of many Zinc(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) molecules collectively coupled to a cavity from first principles. Our theoretical approach incorporates many low-lying electronic excitations in ZnTPP molecules, as well as collective light-matter couplings between ZnTPP and the quantized radiation modes, both of which are shown to be the key to accurately recovering the experimental spectra. We further analyzed to what extent the polariton and dark states are delocalized over many molecules, for the first time, using fully \textit{ab initio} descriptions of the molecules. We finally investigate the linewidth as a function of detuning, providing new theoretical insights into the experimentally observed motional narrowing behavior.

A central challenge which is relevant to many systems, is achieving a balanced description of excited states with distinct electronic characters, such as locally excited (LE) and charge transfer (CT) states, while consistently incorporating environmental effects. Here, we compare the linear-response (LR) and state-averaged (SA) formulations of CASSCF when coupled to the polarizable AMOEBA force field. Using the LE and CT excitations of the substrate–cofactor pair in the photoenzyme CvFAP as a test case, we show that LR- and SA-CASSCF offer complementary strengths. LR-CASSCF provides an unbiased mapping of the excitation manifold, whereas SA-CASSCF can refine selected states to obtain a more quantitative description.

Water is represented as a rigid three-point model, and uncertainties in the non-bonded force field parameters i.e., the Lennard-Jones parameters and partial charges, are propagated forward through the simulations. A large-scale study exploring the capabilities of the multifidelity Monte Carlo framework is conducted, involving six computational models, three different calibrations, cubic and tetragonal simulation box shapes, and two sets of perturbed force field parameters. Results reveal that significant computational speed-ups of up to one order of magnitude can be achieved if successive models have small differences in correlations to the high-fidelity model.

Here, we introduce a unified theoretical framework that rigorously incorporates vibronic contributions through a phase-consistent Herzberg-Teller expansion of the hyperfine Hamiltonian. Its ap- plication to the FMNH•-Cys• radical pair found in AsLOV2 demonstrates how second-order vibronic coupling increases the effective rates of hyperfine-mediated electronic transitions be- tween spin states by a factor of up to a hundred million; from∼ 10^3 s−1 in the Franck-Condon limit to∼ 10^11 s−1 for the S◦ →T◦ transition, and∼ 10^9 s−1 for the T◦ →S◦ in the Herzberg- Teller regime. This observed nanosecond timescale correlates well with the microsecond life- time photoadduct formation central to the function of the wild-type. This work underscores the importance of incorporating a vibronic description in hyperfine-driven dynamics and pro- vides a generalised and transferable methodology that captures essential non-Condon effects even at the single-structure level; thus serving as a complementary tool for systems where full ensemble sampling is impractical or not yet integrated into standard workflows.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6936c2ef65a54c2d4acd0b2f/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |
