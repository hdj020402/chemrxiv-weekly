However, current electrocatalysts rely on either scarce precious metals or transition metals with limited efficiency, and their design strategies lack systematic frameworks for precise optimization guidance. Here, we propose an advanced collaborative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with grand-canonical density functional theory (GCE-DFT) calculations, thereby accelerating the discovery of high-performance and cost-effective electrocatalysts. As a validation, this framework was applied to the promising Fe-N-C oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, demonstrating that asymmetric FeN4 coordination with mixed pyrrolic (pyrr-N) and pyridinic (pyri-N) nitrogen environments serves as a critical determinant of catalytic activity and stability. Furthermore, the integration of GCE-DFT calculations with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the asymmetric FeN4 coordination in Fe-N-C eletrocatalysts induces symmetric electron density redistribution at the Fe active sites, thereby significantly enhancing both catalytic activity and stability. Based on these insights, we synthesized asymmetric N-coordinated FeN4 site in Fe-N-C electrocatalysts via templating-assisted pyrolysis for acidic ORR applications, achieving superior cycle stability (>90% activity retention after 30,000 cycles) while maintaining high activity. This breakthrough successfully addresses the long-standing trade-off riddle between stability and activity in acidic ORR systems. Overall, the proposed framework significantly accelerates the discovery of high-performance and cost-effective electrocatalysts by integrating data-driven artificial intelligence with atomistic-level simulations.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Artificial Intelligence; Electrocatalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Key processes, including knowledge accumulation for predictive design and experimental refinement and validation, are traditionally labor-insensitive and time-consuming, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. Here, we introduce an accelerated, autonomous system for the on-demand synthesis of electronic polymers that achieves desired electrochromic functionality with high accuracy and efficiency. Our approach leverages large language model-assisted data mining, a physics-informed copolymer machine learning model, and an AI-driven autonomous robotic workflow in the Polybot lab. Within 72 hours, Polybot autonomously synthesized electrochromic polymers with targeted, unreported color values, including green polymers with specific absorption profiles, precisely fine-tuning copolymer structures with a 5% step size in comonomer composition within a three-monomer system. A publicly accessible electrochromic polymer informatics database has also been created to foster knowledge exchange.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Polymer Science; Conducting polymers; Organic Polymers; Artificial Intelligence; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6806ca67927d1c2e6621057c/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This work investigates the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology for artificial intelligence and automation based  manipulation of viral antigen expression in order to improve the efficacy and adaptability of vaccination candidates. This approach uses CRISPR-Cas9's accuracy in gene editing to systematically change viral antigens in order to find optimal configurations that elicit strong immune responses. The modern method combines high-throughput screening and analytics to accelerate the identification of effective antigenic targets across several virus strains. The findings show that targeted manipulation of viral antigens can greatly improve immunogenicity, paving the way for adaptable vaccination platforms capable of treating a wide range of viral diseases.

Despite the critical influence of spacer chemistry on phase stability, excitonic behavior, transport properties and environmental robustness, the design space of HPs remains underexplored due to inconsistent reporting and limited structured datasets. To overcome this, we curated a diverse set of 200 experimental papers from various publishers and research groups into Google’s NotebookLM powered by Gemini, utilizing its retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to extract synthesis-relevant metadata with high accuracy and reproducibility. To ensure data quality and consistency, we limited our selection to papers published in peer-reviewed journals with an impact factor above 10, focusing on studies with well-documented experimental protocols. Benchmarking against four other LLMs confirmed NotebookLM’s superior stability and minimal hallucination rate, making it ideal for hypothesis-driven data curation. From extracted IUPAC names, we constructed SMILES representations and augmented the dataset with over 10,000 ammonium-containing molecules from QM9. These were converted into graph-based molecular embeddings and used to train a multitask graph neural network coupled with a Gaussian process (GNN–GP) backend to predict optoelectronic and structural properties with uncertainty quantification. The Latent space clustering of the learned embeddings revealed chemically interpretable families of spacer candidates, which we cross-validated against ChatGPT-generated design heuristics. The convergence between unsupervised clustering and transformer-derived guidance highlights the power of combining LLMs with active learning to generate, test, and refine design hypotheses in underexplored chemical domains. This study demonstrates how fragmented literature can be transformed into actionable, structure–property insights through a tightly integrated informatics pipeline. Our approach lays the foundation for closed-loop, autonomous materials discovery and design and provides a scalable strategy for targeted development of next-generation HPs optoelectronics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "POLARIS: Perovskite Optimization using LLM-Assisted Refinement and Intelligent Screening", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68433433c1cb1ecda0ed97b5/original/polaris-perovskite-optimization-using-llm-assisted-refinement-and-intelligent-screening.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Single Species Scaling (SSS) using rat PK data, with or without unbound plasma fraction (fu,plasma), is commonly used; however, its predictive accuracy is often compromised for compounds with excessive plasma-protein binding. Prior studies have suggested that compounds with fu,plasma < 0.02 in either species are prone to larger prediction errors; however, no systematic approach has addressed this limitation. In this study, we developed a new prediction method, Fraction-based Linear EXtrapolation SSS (FLEX-SSS fu Rat), which dynamically switches between SSS fu Rat and SSS Rat formulas based on an optimized fu threshold. To maximize prediction accuracy, the threshold and associated scaling coefficient were determined using a training set of 200 compounds. Additionally, we constructed a random forest machine-learning model using structural descriptors and validated all models with an independent external dataset of 62 compounds. FLEX-SSS fu Rat outperformed conventional SSS fu Rat, and the consensus model combining FLEX and RF showed the most balanced performance: 41.9% of predictions were within the 2-fold error, only 16.1% exceeded the 5-fold error, and the geometric mean fold error was 2.7. This is the first report to systematically validate the SSS fu Rat method using an independently constructed external dataset. By optimizing fu thresholds and integrating machine learning, our approach enabled more reliable human CL prediction, thereby supporting better-informed decision-making in first-in-human dose selection.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "TableS1_ Comprehensive dataset of plasma unbound fraction (fu,plasma) and clearance (CL) for 262 compounds", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6840ff811a8f9bdab5c67b6e/original/table-s1-comprehensive-dataset-of-plasma-unbound-fraction-fu-plasma-and-clearance-cl-for-262-compounds.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Conventional quantum-chemistry methods, however, often struggle to describe thermodynamic contributions, particularly in systems exhibiting significant anharmonicity and configurational complexity. We employed umbrella sampling, an enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics technique, to compute Gibbs binding free energies for clusters formed from a diverse set of new particle formation precursors, including sulfuric acid, ammonia, dimethylamine, and water. By performing umbrella sampling along the evaporation coordinate, using forces computed at the semi-empirical GFN1-xTB level of theory, we effectively capture entropic effects such as vibrational anharmonicities and transitions between different configurational minima, while avoiding errors from symmetry overcounting. In addition, we explored machine-learning-enhanced umbrella sampling simulations using neural network potentials trained on higher-level quantum chemistry data, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach for improving accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Our results show improved agreement with experimental values compared to conventional methods.  We also present examples of gas-to-particle uptake processes, providing insights into cluster and aerosol--surface chemistry using first-principles approaches rather than commonly used molecular-mechanics force fields. This study demonstrates the importance of accounting for dynamics in predicting molecular binding thermodynamics in complex environments and highlights the potential of combining physics-based simulations with machine learning for reliable and scalable predictions.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "SI", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684a99f53ba0887c33c68223/original/si.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Many practical applications of NNPs focus on single molecules; e.g., using NNPs as a fast replacement for quantum chemical methods for dihedral angle scans in force field development. Similarly, the reference data on which most transferable NNPs have been trained are single molecule properties. As NNPs are beginning to be used to simulate more complex systems, such as solute-solvent simulations, the question arises whether the current generation of transferable NNPs is accurate enough to reproduce condensed phase properties, which in most cases are outside the training domain of the models. Here we present a first analysis of how well two transferable NNPs (ANI-2x, MACE-OFF23(S/M)) perform in reproducing properties such as density, heat of vaporization, heat capacity, and isothermal compressibility of several pure liquids (water, methanol, acetone, benzene, n-hexane at room temperature, and N-methylacetamide at 100 C). In addition, we examine selected radial distribution functions and the self-diffusion constant. We find specific weaknesses for each of the models, and seemingly small flaws lead to poor performance when applied to condensed phase simulations. The varied outcomes observed with the machine learning potentials suggest that, currently, selecting an architecture or model for all-NNP simulations of real-world applications requires careful consideration and testing.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary derivations, figures and tables", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684a82c61a8f9bdab5bcdd70/original/supplementary-derivations-figures-and-tables.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Using this framework, we constructed the MB2061 benchmark set, containing 2061 molecules with high-level PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12 reference data for dissociation reactions. This set provides a challenging benchmark for testing, validation, and training of density functional approximations (DFAs), semiempirical methods, force fields, and machine learning potentials using molecular structures beyond the conventional chemical space. For DFAs, we initially hypothesized that highly parameterized functionals might perform poorly on this set. However, no consistent relationship between fitting strategy and accuracy was observed. A clear Jacob’s ladder trend emerges, with ωB97X-2 achieving the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.4 kcal·mol−1 and r²SCAN-3c offering a robust cost-efficient alternative (19.6 kcal·mol−1). Furthermore, we discuss the performance of selected semiempirical methods and contemporary machine learned interatomic potentials.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "ESI1", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684968b23ba0887c338fa2f5/original/esi1.pdf"}, {"title": "ESI2", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6849690a1a8f9bdab588b418/original/esi2.ods"}, {"title": "Benchmark Set", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68496920c1cb1ecda00ac51b/original/benchmark-set.zip"}]</p></details> |

It contains 20 independent Python scripts and Fortran programs, all with a unified and intuitive handling concept based on command line  arguments. A large repertoire of VASP calculations can be set up with some simple command line calls, including the generation and combination of POSCAR files for bulk and surface slab structures, the respective POTCAR and KPOINTS files and task-specific INCAR files. It further enables the management and evaluation of complex setups not covered by other utility scripts or programs so far, like split-up and parallelized frequency calculations for large structures, or the automated evaluation and visualization of core level energy or Bader partial charge calculations. Emphasis is made on surface-science related calculations, like the targeted placement of adsorbates on substrates or the visualization of scanning-tunneling microscope pictures. Finally, the generation and management of machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on VASP reference data is greatly simplified. Training data collected by on the fly learnings of VASP ML force fields can be effectively selected and combined, or exported into data formats used for Behler-Parrinello neural network or message-passing atomic cluster expansion (MACE) MLIPs. In this publication, all features within utils4VASP are presented concisely, giving both the theoretical background as well as application examples.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

This is particularly the case for specialized tasks such as reaction rate or selectivity prediction. A common solution is to use quantum mechanical (QM) descriptors—physically meaningful features derived from electronic structure calculations—to enhance model robustness in low-data regimes. However, computing these descriptors is costly. Surrogate models address this by predicting QM descriptors directly from molecular structure, enabling fast and scalable input generation for data-efficient downstream ML models. In this study, we compare two strategies for using surrogate models: one that feeds predicted QM descriptors into downstream models, and another that leverages the surrogate’s internal hidden representations instead. Across a diverse set of chemical prediction tasks, we find that hidden representations often outperform QM descriptors, particularly when descriptor selection is not tightly aligned with the downstream task. Only for extremely small datasets or when using carefully selected, task-specific descriptors do the predicted values yield better performance. Our findings highlight that the hidden space of surrogate models captures rich, transferable chemical information, offering a robust and efficient alternative to explicit descriptor use. We recommend this strategy for building data-efficient models in predictive chemistry, especially when feature importance analysis is not a primary goal.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Harnessing Surrogate Models for Data-efficient Predictive Chemistry: Descriptors vs. Learned Hidden Representations", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6848271ac1cb1ecda0d3007e/original/supporting-information-harnessing-surrogate-models-for-data-efficient-predictive-chemistry-descriptors-vs-learned-hidden-representations.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, prevalent databases such as ILThermo frequently exhibit conflicting measurements for the same systems under identical temperature and pressure conditions. These disparities often arise from unaccounted experimental variables—including variances in instrumentation, measurement methodologies, or sample handling—that are inadequately documented in the metadata. Unlike controlled parameters such as temperature or pressure, these concealed inconsistencies introduce systematic biases that undermine data reliability and skew subsequent applications, including separation design, property prediction, and machine learning implementation. To tackle this issue, we propose a thermodynamically informed and statistically sound framework for identifying and resolving internal data conflicts. The approach synthesizes the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation with the Chow test for structural stability to assess the consistency of regression models across different subsets of experimental data. Significant deviations in regression coefficients (indicative of enthalpic and entropic behaviors) serve as flags for identifying and eliminating inconsistent data subsets. Importantly, this methodology does not rely on a predetermined reference; rather, it undertakes thorough pairwise comparisons to ascertain the most self-consistent subsets. This study focuses on establishing a reproducible and generalizable protocol for curating thermophysical data prior to any modeling efforts. As a practical demonstration, we apply this methodology to activity coefficient data, illustrating how physical consistency assessments can markedly enhance dataset integrity. The proposed approach provides a scalable framework for refining extensive experimental datasets, thereby establishing a foundation for more dependable thermodynamic analyses, modeling, and machine-learning applications.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

A key step toward this goal has been made with the GEMS approach to biomolecular dynamics [Sci. Adv. 10, eadn4397 (2024)]. This work introduces the SO3LR method that integrates the fast and stable SO3krates neural network for semi-local interactions with universal pairwise force fields designed for short-range repulsion, long-range electrostatics, and dispersion interactions. SO3LR is trained on a diverse set of 4 million neutral and charged molecular complexes computed at the PBE0+MBD level of quantum mechanics, ensuring broad coverage of covalent and non-covalent interactions. Our approach is characterized by computational and data efficiency, scalability to 200 thousand atoms on a single GPU, and reasonable to high accuracy across the chemical space of organic (bio)molecules. SO3LR is applied to study units of four major biomolecule types, polypeptide folding, and nanosecond dynamics of larger systems such as a protein, a glycoprotein, and a lipid bilayer, all in explicit solvent. Finally, we discuss future challenges toward truly general molecular simulations by combining MLFFs with traditional atomistic models.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

While density functional theory (DFT) remains the mainstream method for transition state searches, inherent trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost persist. To bridge this gap, DeePEST-OS—a generic machine learning potential integrating Δ-learning with a high-order equivariant message passing neural network—is developed to enable rapid and precise transition state searches for organic synthesis. The challenge of data scarcity is addressed through the establishment of a novel reaction database containing ~75,000 DFT-calculated transition states for model training. DeePEST-OS rapidly predicts potential energy surfaces along intrinsic reaction coordinate pathways, achieving speeds nearly three orders of magnitude faster than rigorous DFT computations. High accuracy is simultaneously maintained, exhibiting a root mean square deviation of 0.14 Å for transition states geometries and a mean absolute error of 0.64 kcal/mol for reaction barriers across 1,000 external test reactions—representing significant improvement over semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods. Comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art React-OT model further highlights the superior precision and computational efficiency of DeePEST-OS. A case study involving the retrosynthesis of the drug Zatosetron is also presented to demonstrate the practical utility of DeePEST-OS in accelerating exploration of complex reaction networks.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting materials", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6847ee9c3ba0887c33510872/original/supporting-materials.zip"}]</p></details> |

Machine learning (ML) models, in particular, demonstrate significant promise for the rapid analysis and manipulation (and re-analysis) of both molecular and crystal structures, essential steps to hasten materials design and discovery. A critical element of these approaches, however, is that robust ML potentials be developed that allow for accurate predictions of energies and forces acting on atoms within a given crystal. Here, we present an ML potential trained on 15,000 molecular crystal structures and more than 2.5 million crystal geometries. The ML potential can predict the energies and forces on atoms in a crystal structure comprised of π-conjugated organic molecules with a mean average error (MAE) of 0.022 eV/atom for energy and 0.056 eV/Å for force when compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To enable the use of the ML potential for in silico discovery of functional molecular crystals, we develop workflows for analyzing crystal surfaces and morphologies, and manipulating and relaxing crystal structures. Furthermore, we deploy these workflows on an open-access web-based tool, OCELOT XtalTransform, that bridges the gap between sophisticated simulations and user-friendly interfaces. By offering these capabilities, OCELOT XtalTransform aims to democratize access to advanced ML potentials for functional molecular crystals, thereby providing new mechanisms for materials design and discovery to the broader scientific community.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68434683c1cb1ecda0f33063/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, applying network methods to MD simulations of flexible proteins is a major challenge, since the high conformational heterogeneity in such multi-state systems can lead to vastly different network topolo- gies across an ensemble. To address this, tools that can disentangle conformational ensembles on a network level are needed. Here, we propose a graph-based clustering framework that provides state-specific insight into the residue interactions of flexible proteins. The framework hinges on using the set of graph-theoretic closeness centralities of all amino acid residues as a structural fingerprint and input for unsupervised machine learning algorithms to perform dimensionality reduction and clustering. The resulting clusters - states with shared network topology - are subsequently fed back into the upstream workflow and characterized at every representation level. Based on the example of FAT10 - a protein with intrinsically disordered regions and two folded domains connected by a flexible linker - we demonstrate how this approach can be used to understand the protein’s residue interactions on different, interconnected levels and to characterize its most populated states. Due to the modularity of the framework, it can be easily adapted, which makes it a suitable method to support network-based analyses of MD simulations for a wide variety of proteins.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

These discoveries have only scratched the surface, given the vast compositional and structural diversity that Zintl phases can accommodate. The large chemical space of Zintl phases, as well as intermetallic compounds in general, remain under-explored. Here, we use graph neural networks and the upper bound energy minimization approach to efficiently scan a large chemical space of >90,000 hypothetical Zintl phases and accurately discover 1809 new thermodynamically stable phases with 90% precision, as validated with first-principles calculations. We show that our approach is more than 2X more accurate than M3GNet (40% precision) on the same dataset. Using a random forest model and SHAP analysis, we demonstrate the critical role of ionic bonding in the thermodynamic stability of Zintl phases.

Traditional experimental and quantum chemistry approaches for identifying effective ligands are often resource-intensive. We introduce a machine learning protocol based on an equivariant neural network, Allegro, for the rapid and accurate prediction of binding energies in rare-earth complexes. Key to this work is our newly curated dataset of rare-earth metal complexes—made publicly available to foster further research—systematically generated using the \emph{Architector} program. This dataset distinctively features functionalized derivatives of proven rare-earth-chelating scaffolds, hydroxypyridinone (HOPO), catecholamide (CAM), and their thio-analogues, selected for their established efficacy in binding these elements. Trained on this valuable resource, our Allegro models demonstrate excellent performance, particularly when trained to directly predict DFT-level binding energies, yielding highly accurate results that closely correlate with theoretical calculations on a diverse test set. Furthermore, this strategy exhibited strong out-of-sample generalization, accurately predicting binding energies for an isomeric HOPO-derivative ligand not seen during training. By substantially reducing computational demands, this machine learning framework, alongside the provided dataset, represent powerful tools to accelerate the high-throughput screening and rational design of novel ligands for efficient rare-earth metal separation.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68427c42c1cb1ecda0c22c3b/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Herein, we present the new SBYD31 benchmark set for BODIPY absorption energies and assess 28 different TD-DFT methods, most of which have not been tested on BODIPY dyes before. We show how functionals belonging to the class of recently developed spin-scaled double hybrids with long-range correction (J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2021,17, 5165) overcome the overestimation problem and provide more robust results that have met the chemical accuracy threshold of 0.1 eV. To our knowledge, these are the most accurate absorption energies for BODIPY dyes reported for TD-DFT methods. In passing, we also point out how previous recommendations of "DSD" double hybrids (RSC. Adv., 2022, 12, 1704; Comput. Theor. Chem., 2022, 1207, 113531) were based on incorrect interpretations of the results. Our top-three recommended methods are SOS- ωB2GP-PLYP, SCS-ωB2GP-PLYP and SOS-ωB88PP86 and we verify our recommendations by making predictions, which we confirm with experimental measurements of newly synthesised BODIPY dyes. Our results add to existing evidence how time-dependent double hybrids with spin-component scaling and long-range correction solve notoriously hard cases for conventional TD- DFT methods and we are confident that our recommendations will assist in future developments of BODIPY dyes.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.); Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "SI part 1: Computational and Experimental Data", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684937743ba0887c33849d36/original/si-part-1-computational-and-experimental-data.pdf"}, {"title": "SI Part 2: optimised structures", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684937743ba0887c33849d3b/original/si-part-2-optimised-structures.zip"}]</p></details> |

We conducted a quantitative analysis of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) processing enzymes across all enzymatic reactions, revealing their dominance in phosphate reactivity with ATP as the most prevalent substrate. Two main reaction types occur predominantly: cleavage resulting in (i) pyrophosphate or (ii) phosphate release/transfer. The large majority of NTP processing enzymes require divalent Mg2+ ions in a mechanistically analogous manner. Despite their importance, the precise coordination of metal ions in the catalytically competent active site structure in many NTP processing enzymes remains elusive. We hypothesized that efficient phosphate processing requires specific metal ion coordination, facilitating the catalytic reaction. By examining a vast dataset of crystallographic structures, we identified a universal "Mg-pinch" motif, confirming our structural hypothesis for almost all NTP processing enzymes. We postulated that the Mg2+ ion should coordinate both phosphates that are involved in the cleaved P-O bond. We present a comprehensive analysis of NTP processing superfamilies across all species, determining distinct enzyme active site structures. We highlight exceptional cases and propose challenging superfamilies that lack sufficient structural data to determine precise active site coordination. Our quantum mechanical calculations based on DFT-based QM/MM with full electrostatic embedding revealed the essential electrostatic polarization effects of the Mg²⁺ ion as key determinants of their role in the enzyme catalysis. The Mg-pinch motif provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the catalytic role of metal ions in NTP processing. Our findings offer insights into enzyme evolution, provide a basis for rational enzyme engineering, and could inform the development of novel therapeutics targeting NTP processing enzymes.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biochemistry; Chemical Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information and data for Nature counts to three: Universal Mg-pinch motif polarizes the cleaved bond in NTP-processing enzymes", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6849c8681a8f9bdab599228a/original/supporting-information-and-data-for-nature-counts-to-three-universal-mg-pinch-motif-polarizes-the-cleaved-bond-in-ntp-processing-enzymes.pdf"}]</p></details> |

While significant theoretical advancements have been made in this area, the majority of existing studies rely on model-based approaches and focus on molecular ensembles in the dilute gas limit. However, extending these studies to more complex systems, such as condensed phases or larger molecular aggregates, is not only essential but also presents a significant challenge due to the increased complexity and the demand for more accurate and computationally intensive methods. Here, we present an investigation of cavity-modified local molecular properties in both non-interacting water molecular ensembles and hydrogen-bonded water clusters, utilizing an atomistic, fully ab initio and analytical approach, which combines the cavity Born--Oppenheimer density functional theory with the Hirshfeld partitioning scheme to quantify local dipole moment and polarizability. We observe that the cavity induces non-zero changes in the local dipole moment and polarizability, with the dipole self-energy term being critical for these modifications, particularly in configurations where the total dipole moment of the molecular ensemble is zero. In hydrogen-bonded water clusters, hydrogen bonding enhances cavity-induced polarization in acceptor molecules while suppressing it in donors, and it mitigates the cavity-induced reduction in local polarizability. These results underscore the interplay between intermolecular interactions and cavity effects on molecular properties in optical cavities.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Local Molecular Properties of Non-Interacting and Hydrogen-Bonded Water Systems in Vibrational Strong Coupling Regimes", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68482a651a8f9bdab550ed7b/original/supporting-information-local-molecular-properties-of-non-interacting-and-hydrogen-bonded-water-systems-in-vibrational-strong-coupling-regimes.pdf"}]</p></details> |

As a proof of concept, we perform a multidimensional, multi-objective parameterization of a rigid water model over a large pressure [1-5000 atm] and temperature [274.15-372.15 K] range to the experimental property surfaces estimated using the IAPWS95 equation of state for water.  Over 4000 parameter combinations in six-dimensional parameter space were explored during the minimization.  A similar parameterization with standard techniques would have taken more than 2000 CPU years but with the application of the newly developed techniques, the computational time was reduced to eight CPU weeks.  Without the added efficiency of the methods presented here, the optimization could not have simultaneously taken into account the large range of temperature and pressure points used in the fitting. The paper also describes how and why incorporating the thermodynamic properties from the first and second derivatives of Gibbs energy into the objective function help improve the parameterization process.  

The resulting water model reproduces liquid phase density within the upper limit of experimental uncertainty of 0.02% over a large range of temperatures and pressures, the most accurate model yet at this low level of theory over the entire range of temperature and pressure, with little loss of fidelity in other properties. We compare the performance of this water model with twelve other rigid water models in predicting a number of other thermodynamic and kinetic properties. This process illustrates the surprising fact that a simple point charge model is able to accurately capture a substantial range of both temperature and pressure-dependent thermodynamics without substantial deviation from experiment at ambient temperatures and pressures.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Thermodynamics (Chem.

MPAC functionals operate holistically at the electronic level, require no heuristic dispersion corrections, and achieve near-chemical accuracy even for abnormal NCIs, cases where DFT+DISP errors exceed those of DFT. To further improve MPAC for abnormal cases without compromising overall performance, we introduce MPAC25, a simple two-parameter functional treating neutral and charged NCIs equally, as demonstrated on DES15K benchmarks. Overall, MPAC functionals effectively describe a wide range of NCIs, including those beyond the reach of other methods, representing a significant step toward predictive simulations of molecular interactions in complex environments and motivating further MPAC developments.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Inoformation for: M\u00f8ller-Plesset Adiabatic Connection Theory for Diverse Noncovalent Interactions", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6814f44a927d1c2e66ba9ce3/original/supporting-inoformation-for-m-ller-plesset-adiabatic-connection-theory-for-diverse-noncovalent-interactions.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Recent advances addressing this complexity include cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) generalizations of complete active space configuration interaction and density matrix renormalization group methods. In this work, we introduce a QED extension of state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field theory, which incorporates cavity-induced correlations through a second-order orbital optimization framework with robust convergence properties. The method is implemented using both photon number state and coherent state representations, with the latter showing robust origin invariance in the energies regardless of the completeness of the photonic Fock space.  The implementation enables symmetry-free orbital relaxations to account for photon-mediated symmetry breaking in polaritonic systems. Numerical validation on lithium hydride, hydroxide anion, and magnesium hydride cation demonstrates that this method achieves significantly improved accuracy in modeling ground-state and polariton potential energy surfaces compared to QED-CASCI in a fixed orbital basis.  In these studies, we reach sub-kcal/mol accuracy in potential energy surface in much smaller active spaces than are required for QED-CASCI.

The end-point free energy calculation with many variants in terms of sampling protocols and post-processing details is recognized as a crucial component of hierarchical screening. The fusion of the two techniques is explored in the current work, using a series of receptor-ligand datasets accumulated in our recent papers on host-guest binding. A thorough exploration of parameter combinations is presented. Specifically, both the popular and naïve single-trajectory sampling protocol and the three-trajectory realization that incorporates the conformational variation of individual components upon binding are considered. The sampled configurations are fed to an extensive combination of xTB Hamiltonians (GFN0, GFN1 and GFN2) and implicit solvent models (PB, GB and the most recent CPCM-X). The host-guest datasets involve macrocyclic hosts from three families, including cucurbiturils, octa acids and pillararenes, and each host is paired with a number of guest molecules to ensure the coverage of chemical space and the stability of performance statistics. The xTB implicit-solvent estimates exhibit a certain level of correlations with the experimental binding thermodynamics, with the three-trajectory GFN2-xTB/PB ΔH selection producing the top-tier performance across different host families. Face-to-face comparison between the xTB implicit-solvent performance with the top-performing MM/GBSA selections suggests that the three-trajectory MM/GBSA regimes outperform xTB variants in most cases. However, in situations that the MM/GBSA Hamiltonian fails severely (e.g., the difficult-to-handle sulfur-substituted pillararene dataset), altering the postprocessing Hamiltonian to the multiscale xTB implicit-solvent treatment could better the screening power. This observation agrees with our recent report on unexpectedly high performance of DFTB/GBSA in another difficult dataset (the SAMPL9 carboxylated pillararene), hinting on the potential applicability of the tight-binding implicit-solvent treatments.  </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

The recently introduced STGABS27 benchmark set provides highly accurate, experimentally measured adiabatic energy gaps (ΔEₛₜ) between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states of thermally activated delayed-fluorescence (TADF) emitters. While first studies reported excellent performance for orbital-optimized, state-specific ΔDFT and mixed results for TD-DFT and DFT/MRCI, this work assesses correlated wave-function approaches—specifically second-order Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction (ADC(2)) and the second-order approximate Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles (CC2)—in their canonical and spin-scaled variants. Because these excited states are strongly polar, particular attention is given to the dielectric treatment of the solvent. We find that only a few combinations—most notably the iterative, state-specific COSMO model paired with spin-component- or spin-opposite-scaled (SCS/SOS) ADC(2) or CC2—match the accuracy of ΔDFT/PCM, yielding sub-kcal mol⁻¹ agreement with experimental singlet–triplet gaps, a result corroborated by emission energies. This accuracy, however, is expensive: the best-performing ADC(2)/CC2-based protocols are roughly 100 times slower than comparably accurate ΔDFT/PCM calculations.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Info", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/684193651a8f9bdab5ec008c/original/supporting-info.pdf"}]</p></details> |
