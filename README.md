Here we introduce ReactionForge, a novel Temporal Graph Network architecture specifically designed for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling yield prediction that addresses these challenges through five key innovations. First, we implement persistent temporal memory mechanisms using Gated Recurrent Units to track catalyst evolution and reagent dynamics across reaction sequences. Second, we develop cross-attention layers that explicitly compare reactant and product molecular graphs, learning which structural changes most influence reaction outcomes. Third, we incorporate hierarchical graph pooling via Self-Attention Graph Pooling to automatically discover functional group patterns. Fourth, we employ evidential deep learning to provide calibrated epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in a single forward pass. Fifth, we use multi-task learning with yield, selectivity, and reaction time as joint objectives to improve generalization. Evaluated on 5,760 Suzuki-Miyaura reactions spanning five metal catalysts and diverse substrates, ReactionForge achieves R² = 0.968 ± 0.004 (RMSE = 5.12 ± 0.18%, MAE = 3.89 ± 0.12%), representing statistically significant improvements over YieldGNN (R² = 0.957 ± 0.005, paired t-test p = 0.002) and YieldBERT (R² = 0.810 ± 0.010, p < 0.001). The model provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates (Expected Calibration Error = 0.031) that enable uncertainty-guided active learning, achieving 37% improved data efficiency over random sampling. Systematic ablation studies reveal that each architectural component contributes measurably to performance, with cross-attention and temporal memory each adding approximately ΔR² = 0.005. Interpretability analysis shows that learned attention weights successfully recover known structure-reactivity relationships, including chloride activation challenges and ligand-substrate compatibility patterns. Despite architectural complexity, ReactionForge trains 28% faster than YieldGNN. This work demonstrates that chemically motivated architectural innovations in graph neural networks can meaningfully advance reaction prediction when properly grounded in mechanistic understanding.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

While such predictions have the potential to provide mechanistic insight for high-impact applications such as synthesis planning and reaction optimization, the field remains at an early stage of development. This Perspective discusses and critically assesses the current state-of-the art in reaction property prediction, highlighting the key limitations related to data availability and quality, molecular and transformation representations, and machine learning architectures used in both predictive and generative models. A special focus is given on current challenges and on possible paths forward toward efficient and accurate machine learning models for on-the-fly prediction of reaction energetics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

However, quantitative EXAFS interpretation still relies on manually constructed structural models and extensive parameter tuning, creating a growing bottleneck as experimental datasets increase in size and complexity. Addressing this bottleneck requires a direct and systematic mapping between atomic structure and EXAFS response. Here we introduce AI-EXAFS, a physics-informed graph neural network that predicts full EXAFS spectra directly from three-dimensional atomic coordinates. By formulating the learning problem around the physical principles governing EXAFS signal formation, the model learns transferable structure–spectrum relationships and eliminates the need for user-defined parameter selection at inference. Trained on 86,000 transition-metal complexes, AI-EXAFS reproduces reference theoretical spectra with accuracy consistent with established EXAFS analysis practice and generalizes to experimentally relevant systems, including platinum single-atom catalysts. AI-EXAFS provides an accurate and readily deployable forward model for EXAFS, enabling standardized first-pass structural screening and offering a scalable foundation for future extensions toward more realistic and data-rich EXAFS analysis.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Artificial Intelligence; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6957b84b098cdc781f51bfcd/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

With minimal human intervention, we combined AI-driven molecular design and retrosynthesis with IBM’s synthesis automation system RoboRXN and Arctoris’ Ulysses platform for automated in-vitro screening. We performed two Design-Make-Test-Analyze (DMTA) cycles with a total of 36 synthesized compounds. In the first round, the generative model identified structural analogs of established JAK inhibitors despite being blinded from known JAK inhibitors. The second iteration yielded molecules with significantly improved pIC50 and ligand efficiency (p < 0.001) compared to the first round, underscoring the effectiveness of the closed-loop workflow.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

We report the outcomes and key insights from an open science community blind challenge focused on computational methods in drug discovery, using lead optimization data from the AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) Discovery Consortium’s pan-coronavirus antiviral discovery program, in partnership with Polaris and the OpenADMET project. This collaborative initiative invited global participants from both academia and industry to develop and apply computational methods to predict the biochemical potency and crystallographic ligand poses of small molecules against key coronavirus targets, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) main protease (Mpro), as well as multiple ADMET assay endpoints, using previously undisclosed comprehensive experimental drug discovery datasets as benchmarks. By evaluating submissions across multiple tasks and compounds, we established performance leaderboards and conducted meta-analyses to assess methodological strengths, common pitfalls, and areas for improvement. This analysis provides a foundation for best practices in real-world machine learning evaluation, grounded in community-driven benchmarking. We also highlight how next-generation platforms, such as Polaris, enable rigorous challenge design, embedded evaluation frameworks, and broad community engagement. This paper reports the collective findings of the challenge, offering a high-level overview of the data, evaluation infrastructure, and top- performing strategies. We further provide context and support for the accompanying papers authored by the challenge participants in this special issue, which explore individual approaches in greater depth. Together, these contributions aim to advance reproducible, trustworthy, and high-impact computational methods in drug discovery, and to explore best practices and pitfalls in future blind challenge design and execution, including planned initiatives for the OpenADMET project.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Figures", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/695db4c2900d745c43b8ecc3/original/supplementary-figures.pdf"}]</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Deep Learning Dominance: A Scaffold-Aware Hybrid Framework for Robust Toxicity Prediction in Data-Scarce Regimes](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/694b4014e3cb457e1381ea0b/original/beyond-deep-learning-dominance-a-scaffold-aware-hybrid-framework-for-robust-toxicity-prediction-in-data-scarce-regimes.pdf)** | 2026-01-05 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-f6g15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational toxicology plays a pivotal role in modern drug discovery and environmental risk assessment; however, the reliability of predictive models on unseen chemical scaffolds remains a critical bottleneck. Deep learning architectures, despite their prevalence, are susceptible to ’silent failures’—yielding high-confidence errors on out-of-distribution data—which poses significant risks in safety-critical applications. In this study, we propose a ’Safe-byDesign’ hybrid framework to mitigate this epistemic uncertainty. Rather than relying on a single algorithmic paradigm, we integrate the explicit structural ’memory’ of classical Random Forests with the topological ’intuition’ of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) via a transparent Stacking Ensemble (Logistic Regression) functioning as a Mixture of Experts (MoE). Evaluated across 12 Tox21 endpoints using a rigorous 5-seed benchmarking protocol under Nested Scaffold Split, our analysis demonstrates that classical models serve as an essential robustness layer in data-scarce regimes. Crucially, the Hybrid MoE functions as a fail-safe mechanism, preventing performance degradation in tasks where pure GNNs struggle to generalize (e.g., NR-AR-LBD), while leveraging complementary strengths in others (e.g., SR-MMP). Benchmarking against the industry-standard DeepChem GraphConv model reveals statistical equivalence (p > 0.05) in overall performance, with the Hybrid framework exhibiting superior predictive stability in 7 out of 12 assays, particularly in complex endpoints such as SR-p53 and Androgen Receptor targets. These findings suggest that the proposed architecture offers a viable pathway toward achieving state-of-the-art predictive power without compromising the interpretability required for regulatory acceptance.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Full Project Archive: Code, Datasets, and Results", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/694b4676afb3b11118fa130a/original/full-project-archive-code-datasets-and-results.zip"}]</p></details> |

We trained AMPv3 on our recently published biomolecular multiscale simulation (BMS25) dataset and demonstrated the model’s high eﬃciency, which enabled us to simulate proteins involving thousands of atoms at DFT accuracy in addition to explicit MM solvent for up to hundred nanoseconds, which presents a major leap for contemporary NNPs. We observe excellent scaling to large systems on a single GPU. AMPv3-BMS25 (or short AMP-BMS) shows promising performance on benchmarks and we demonstrate that the model can be used to accurately estimate experimental properties, including solvation free energies of small molecules and structural features of proteins. Finally, AMP-BMS/MM was employed to predict the free-energy profiles of reactions catalyzed by the enzymes chorismate mutase and fluoroacetate dehalogenase. In total, AMP-BMS/MM was used to simulate proteins in the condensed phase for a cumulative 23 µs simulation time or 48 billion integration steps. This work establishes AMP-BMS as a highly eﬃcient and accurate model for multiscale simulations of biomolecules.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary material", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/695c176c083c11e4a1f36332/original/supplementary-material.pdf"}]</p></details> |

While Raman spectra of small molecules often permit direct structural interpretation, intermediate-sized systems—such as glycans, short nucleic acids, and peptides—exhibit higher compositional and conformational heterogeneity that obscures structure–spectrum relationships. We introduce DynaSpec, a framework integrating metadynamics performed in a machine-learned latent space with population-weighted DFT Raman calculations and experimental Raman spectroscopy to enable quantitative, bidirectional mapping between molecular structure and vibrational spectra. By determining equilibrium conformational populations and linking normal modes to the structural coordinates that modulate them, DynaSpec enables mechanistic interpretation of congested Raman profiles. Applied to glycans, DynaSpec’s ensemble-averaged DFT predictions agree with experimentally acquired spectra that support >85% classification accuracy across 13 N-glycans. Metadynamics reveals a conserved α6 open–curled switching motif, and the combined analysis identifies a glycosidic torsion-enriched window that enables experimental positional isomer discrimination to >70% accuracy. DynaSpec also generalizes to O-glycans and sulfated glycosaminoglycans. Together, these capabilities establish an ensemble-resolved framework for structure-informed spectroscopy for different classes of biomolecules.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information File", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/695daa61083c11e4a12dd847/original/supplementary-information-file.pdf"}]</p></details> |

For chromophores in the condensed phase, these spectra, which incorporate the coupling between electronic excitation and molecular and solvent nuclear motions, can be simulated using excitation energies obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of the chromophore and solvent. Here, we present a hybrid scheme that exploits machine learning and physically informed spectral densities to show that as few as 25 ground and excited state energetic gradient calculations can be used to construct models that accurately predict environment-influenced vibronic coupling in optical spectra. We demonstrate our approach for the green fluorescent protein chromophore in water and the cresyl violet chromophore in methanol. We show that our hybrid approach, employing a machine learning model for the high-frequency spectral density and an ab initio parameterized Debye spectral density for the low-frequency, results in systematic improvement of the optical absorption lineshape, leading to a simple machine learning scheme that can be used for simulation of spectral densities and optical spectra.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/695d71a8098cdc781f267996/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}, {"title": "Supplementary Information - Codes and Datasets", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/695d71f9098cdc781f26915c/original/supplementary-information-codes-and-datasets.zip"}]</p></details> |

The model embeds a classic excess-Gibbs free energy formulation, ensuring Gibbs–Duhem consistency on all predicted activity coefficients. Given molecular SMILES, liquid-phase composition, and temperature, EquiNet predicts vapor composition and pressure, enabling end-to-end training on experimental data without requiring precomputed activity coefficients. Across the UNIFAC-scope VLE dataset (covering 55,470 binary datapoints), EquiNet achieves a log10 Pressure (Pa) RMSE of 0.0659, outperforming UNIFAC (0.087) and the HANNA machine-learning model (0.101) under the same molecular-scope assumptions. For evaluation on previously unseen chemical systems, we follow a novel-mixture cross-validation protocol that demonstrated strong transferability across diverse functional groups and molecular classes. On the public Jaubert benchmark, restricted to UNIFAC-compatible pairs (2,099 points), EquiNet attains a comparable 0.03436 log10 Pressure (Pa) RMSE, substantially below HANNA (0.26743) and UNIFAC (1.55616). This work employs a modified Raoult’s law approach without vapor-phase fugacity or Poynting corrections and is limited to neutral, organic, non-reactive binary mixtures composed of supported elements. The method does not detect mixture criticality, and any supercritical examples should be interpreted qualitatively.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Thermodynamics (Chem.

Li-Argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) is a promising SSE with high ionic conductivity, produced using cheap and sustainable precursors, and therefore of interest to both academia and industry. Like many other sulfide-based SSEs, it is however unstable against Li-metal. Using ab-initio and machine-learning methods, we simulate three representative Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interface models to investigate whether the exact surface termination affects the chemical stability and ion transport capability. We present a systematic approach to create low-energy interfaces by screening 28 low Miller-index surface terminations of Li-argyrodite and coupling them with Li-metal. Custom-made machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ab-initio data enable the simulation of large interface models with over 2000 atoms for 5 ns. We find that all three interfaces decompose into an amorphous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, consisting of Li3P, Li2S and LiCl, which then crystallizes into an antifluorite phase Li2S{1-x-y}P{x}Cl{y}; {x,y = 0.14-0.15}. A two orders of magnitude decrease in Li-ion flux shows that the crystalline SEI layer is a sluggish ion conductor, similar to Li2S. While all three interfaces form the same crystalline SEI layer, the exact rates of the decomposition and crystallisation depend on the actual surface composition. These atomic-level insights could potentially be used to control the SEI formation in sulphide-based SSEs and others.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information for Atomistic insights into the chemical stability and ionic transport at Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interfaces", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/695bc4ec083c11e4a1e97d4f/original/supplementary-information-for-atomistic-insights-into-the-chemical-stability-and-ionic-transport-at-li-metal-li-argyrodite-interfaces.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Using the photoisomerization of a molecular motor as a prototype, this study integrates enhanced sampling and active learning to construct accurate machine-learned multi-state potential energy surfaces (PESs). By combining active-learning trajectories with enhanced sampling, our approach efficiently covers substantial reaction regions, enabling trajectory propagation extending to tens of picoseconds at a low computational cost within the machine learning framework. Furthermore, local control theory (LCT) is employed to selectively activate specific vibrational motions, leading to accelerated access to reactive regions, enhanced nonadiabatic transitions, and significantly improved selectivity toward the dominant photoproduct. This combined strategy of machine-learning potentials and LCT offers an efficient and generalizable framework for controlling excited-state dynamics in complex systems.

While we have shown that RAZOR successfully reproduces ab initio results for adsorbates on metallic surfaces in an implicit solvent environment, real electrochemical applications require the inclusion of at least a few explicit H2O layers of the electrolyte. Here, we benchmark RAZOR's performance in the description of the Pt(111)-H2O interface. We show that RAZOR can reliably reproduce ab initio molecular dynamics findings for bias-induced changes in H2O density and orientation profiles as well as changes in the potential. To do so, a specific training procedure needs to be applied which avoids the erroneous learning of artifacts from the dielectric breakdown of interfacial water and the accompanying charge transfer into the H2O layers. Ultimately, we are confident that RAZOR can provide quantitative predictions in a +/- 20 muC/cm2 window around the neutral-charged cell, which is sufficient for many pressing electrochemical questions.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Electrochemistry - Mechanisms, Theory & Study | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Material", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/694be6ba6e8e74030e688bd7/original/supplementary-material.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Computational techniques based on Monte Carlo simulation can be used to predict the gas adsorption properties of COFs with high accuracy, however they are too inefficient to be deployed in a high-throughput manner for screening large COF databases. In this paper, we systematically train and evaluate a range of machine learning models for predicting the Henry coefficients for CO2 and CH4 gas adsorption in COF materials. To account for COF structural variability, we train our models on datasets that include both chemically functionalized frameworks and interlayer displaced stacking configurations. By comparing predictive performance across descriptor–model architecture combinations, we demonstrate how different models capture the key physical factors governing gas adsorption, including electrostatics, local atomic environments, and van der Waals interactions. Our results therefore provide a framework for building machine learning models for scalable, high-throughput screening of COF materials with targeted gas adsorption properties.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69535a53098cdc781fb38d74/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here, we present an experimentally validated computational framework combining hybrid-resolution molecular dynamics and machine learning for the discovery of β-sheet-rich amyloid-forming peptides. Through exhaustive simulations of all 8,000 tripeptides, we demonstrate that the widely used aggregation propensity (AP) is not effective in predicting β-sheet assembly. We introduce Amyloid-Like Tendency (ALT), a metric enabled by our hybrid-resolution simulations that effectively identifies cross-β architectures. Leveraging this physics-informed dataset, we further fine-tuned the Uni-Mol model to efficiently screen 160,000 tetrapeptides. Experimental validation of 46 candidates confirmed a predictive accuracy of ~85%, yielding 26 novel amyloid-forming peptides, including multiple hydrogelators. Mechanistic analysis reveals that specific sidechain stacking and central amino acid identity, beyond generic hydrophobicity, dictate ordered assembly. This establishes a scalable pipeline for the targeted design of functional peptide materials.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Biocompatible Materials; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/694d4fd7e3cb457e13d499dd/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

In this work, we present a dual-head convolutional neural network for multi-label functional group identification directly from single infrared spectra. The proposed architecture captures complementary local and global spectral information through parallel convolutional pathways with cross-scale alignment. The model is evaluated on NIST-derived gas-phase IR datasets covering 21 functional groups using five-fold cross-validation. It achieves a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 0.9169, indicating improved performance across functional groups. In addition to the overall results, the proposed architecture shows improved recognition for several challenging functional groups, as reflected by per-class evaluation and ablation analysis. Overall, this work provides a scalable baseline for IR-based functional group identification and clarifies both the capabilities and current limitations of single-modality infrared analysis, offering a foundation for future extensions toward multi-modal spectroscopic learning approaches.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

This work introduces ReactFormer, a novel deep learning framework designed to predict reaction barrier heights with high accuracy solely from two-dimensional molecular graphs of reactants, thus eliminating the need for explicit transition state information. ReactFormer employs a reaction-aware graph Transformer architecture, which includes multi-view reactant encoding and a unique Virtual Reaction Center Node, enabling it to effectively capture complex reaction features and implicitly infer transition state characteristics. Evaluated on the RDB7 dataset, ReactFormer achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 2.40 $\pm$ 0.12 kcal/mol on the random split, matching or even slightly surpassing the performance of three-dimensional dependent models. Furthermore, ReactFormer demonstrates significantly improved computational efficiency and robust generalization across various out-of-distribution scenarios, including splits based on molecular size, target barrier height, reaction core, and reactant scaffold. An ablation study confirms the critical contributions of its core components. ReactFormer represents a significant step towards efficient, accurate, and generalizable deep learning models for chemical reaction dynamics, fostering advancements in drug discovery, materials science, and catalysis. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

This has given rise to several generations of validation sets that address previously reported shortcomings of earlier collections. This is an iterative and expensive method of curating validation sets that leaves ample scope for discrepancies between actives and decoys to creep in. It has previously been conjectured that in silico isomerization offers an attractive alternative to generating decoys for drug-like compounds that naturally mitigates many of these discrepancies. Here, we explore this proposition and prove the conjecture. We show that isomerization can produce molecules that have hydrogen bond acceptor, donor, rotatable bonds counts, charge and surface area distributions that match more closely experimental actives than experimental decoys. While these are properties that receive a lot of attention in drug design, we also show that isomerization can effectively produce decoys that are positioned more closely to actives in property hyperspace than current experimental decoys which tend to be highly dissimilar from the actives. The latter is a significant shortcoming that has thus far remained unreported and unaddressed. Herein, we build upon the methods, tools, and work of others to facilitate the generation of new and better validation sets more cheaply and efficiently in the hope of moving the field of VHTS forward toward maturity. To that end, we make our code fully and freely available on GitHub.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "In Silico Isomerization Produces Apt Negative Data for VHTS Validation", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/695b7abf098cdc781fe0e9f7/original/in-silico-isomerization-produces-apt-negative-data-for-vhts-validation.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Reference data were obtained using the high-level coupled-cluster CC3 model in combination with the aug-cc-pVTZ atomic basis set, providing the first systematic dataset of e0xcited-state polarizabilities at this level of theory. The studied set includes both valence and Rydberg states, the latter  exhibiting significantly larger polarizabilities, reflecting their diffuse character and enhanced sensitivity to external electric fields. The benchmark analysis includes lower-order wavefunction-based methods, namely CCSD and CC2, as well as Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) with several common density functional approximations (B3LYP, MN15, M06-2X, CAM-B3LYP, and LC-BLYP). The statistical analysis enables the evaluation of the impact of orbital relaxation and highlights method-dependent differences across the different kind of excited states, as well as according to the different chemical character of molecules. The results indicate that CCSD, both in its relaxed and unrelaxed forms, provides the most accurate description of excited-state polarizabilities, closely followed by CC2, which can therefore be generally employed as a computationally efficient yet reliable alternative. Among the TD-DFT functionals, range-separated hybrids – particularly LC-BLYP – perform best, while larger errors are observed for the three evaluated global hybrids.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information for: Excited-State Polarizabilities: CC3 Reference Values, Wavefunction and TD-DFT Benchmarks", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/695bd2e0900d745c43758dbd/original/supporting-information-for-excited-state-polarizabilities-cc3-reference-values-wavefunction-and-td-dft-benchmarks.pdf"}]</p></details> |

These are often used in conjunction with linear response TD-DFT to get the excited state energy and its gradients. At each step of an MD simulation, the new molecular geometry is relatively close to the previous ones, suggesting that some extrapolation strategy can be applied, such that the results of the previous calculations, which are available for free, can be used to predict the result of the upcoming calculation. The prediction can then be used as a guess for the iterative solver to lower the number of iterations and thus the cost. In this contribution, we present an extension of the Grassmann extrapolation scheme (GExt) to linear response TD-DFT, in which the knowledge about the manifold structure to which the solutions belong is used to make the extrapolation more accurate. The new extrapolation strategy is then tested on four systems showing a significant acceleration of the excited state molecular dynamics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69579119900d745c43d879a1/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Enol-germenolate 8 is the first reported enol-tautomer of a germenolate. 8 has a nearly planar geometry around the Ge atom (Σ∡(Ge)=355.1°) and a short Ge=C bond (1.885 Å). In contrast, its keto-tautomer 9 has pyramidal geometry around the Ge (Σ∡(Ge) = 299.0°) and a significantly longer Ge–C bond (2.062 Å). This is the first example of a heavy Group 14 enolate, which can be isolated as both the keto- and the enol-tautomer, depending on the coordinated solvent. In THF solution, the precursor germenolate exists mainly as the keto-tautomer (tBuMe2Si)2Ge–C(=O···Li·nTHF)(1 Ad) (10). When isolated in the solid state, 10 becomes the enol-tautomer [(tBuMe2Si)2Ge=C(OLi·THF)(1 Ad)]2 (12), as determined by NMR, ssNMR, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. 

Our results show that solution NMR, ssNMR, or UV/Vis spectroscopy, combined with routine DFT calculations, can be a reliable tool for assigning the structures of heavier Group 14 enolates and for characterizing their keto-enol (or intermediate) tautomeric form in solution and in the solid state - even without crystallographic data.

However, toward broader application of MLFFs, a unified and automated computational platform remains lacking. Here, we develop MAPLE, a program specifically designed for MLFF-based molecular modeling, featuring a tailored framework and parallelized algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate the robustness and usability of MAPLE through systematic benchmarking of modern reactive MLFFs and applications to multiple biocatalytic scenarios, highlighting its capability for fast yet accurate simulation of catalytic reactions.
