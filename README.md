| **[LifeLong Learning for Large Language Models in Predicting Chemical Reaction Yields](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686c51a73ba0887c331fbd9d/original/life-long-learning-for-large-language-models-in-predicting-chemical-reaction-yields.pdf)** | 2025-07-10 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xtvpc | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures excel at internet-scale tasks. However, real-world scientific scenarios—such as synthetic chemistry laboratories and autonomous experimental setups—typically involve incremental data generation in batches as new chemical reactions are conducted, unlike static, large-scale datasets. Motivated by scaling laws—which suggest that larger models are increasingly prone to catastrophic forgetting when learning from sequentially arriving data— we present a case study investigating continual learning for chemical reaction yield prediction using Mistral-7B, a 7.3-billion-parameter open-weight LLM. We first establish a baseline by evaluating model performance on the Suzuki Coupling Reactions dataset using both supervised full fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), showing competitive yield prediction accuracy. To mimic real-world conditions, we adopt a task-incremental learning framework in which the model incrementally learns a new task group defined by unique pairs of reactants. This sequential learning setup enables us to directly assess the model’s ability to retain prior knowledge. We demonstrate that when the model is trained within this sequential learning paradigm with traditional procedures, it exhibits significant loss of prior knowledge, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting in the continual learning community—an under-recognized challenge in the chemistry community. To understand this challenge, we first model the problem of continual learning and investigate the source of forgetting, subsequently, we incorporate experience replay to maintain near-baseline performance across tasks without forgetting. These results highlight the importance of integrating continual learning strategies into LLM-based chemical modeling pipelines, particularly as future experimental platforms increasingly generate non-stationary reaction data.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686c580ac1cb1ecda098f7b7/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Current optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) and named entity recognition solutions operate in isolation, which limits their scalability for comprehensive literature curation. Here we present MARCUS (Molecular Annotation and Recognition for Curating Unravelled Structures), a tool to aid curators in performing literature curation in the field of natural products. This integrated web-based platform combines automated text annotation, multi-engine OCSR, and direct submission capabilities to the COCONUT database. MARCUS employs a fine-tuned GPT-4 model to extract chemical entities and utilises an ensemble approach integrating DECIMER, MolNexTR, and MolScribe for structure recognition. The platform aims to streamline the data extraction workflow from PDF upload to database submission, significantly reducing curation time. MARCUS bridges the gap between unstructured chemical literature and machine-actionable databases, enabling FAIR data principles and facilitating AI-driven chemical discovery. Through open-source code, accessible models, and comprehensive documentation, the web application enhances accessibility and promotes community-driven development. This approach facilitates unrestricted use and encourages the collaborative advancement of automated chemical literature curation tools. 


We dedicate MARCUS to Dr Marcus Ennis, the longest-serving curator of the ChEBI database, on the occasion of his 75th birthday.  </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

While GNNs excel in identifying local patterns within molecules, their ability to capture global properties remains limited due to inherent structural challenges such as oversmoothing and their expressivity.  We build a simple GNN-based model which integrates chemistry knowledge that GNNs may have difficulties to learn. We show that this combination greatly enhance the accuracy compared to a pure GNN approach. It is on part with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) of much larger models, including large foundation models, and even outperforms them in some cases, on several benchmarks. With a simple approach, this study highlights some limitations of GNNs and the crucial benefit of giving GNN models easy access to global information about the graph, in the context of applications to chemistry.  We focus on regression tasks at the molecular level, on small molecules datasets. We also investigate the possible localization of molecular substructures important for the GNN prediction, using the SMILES encoding. We design a GNN predicting molecule properties at the node level, allowing to identify important nodes for the prediction, therefore showing better explainability.  Additionally, the model's architecture allows for efficient training with relatively modest computational resources, making it practical for widespread application. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance. The code and data is available at : https://molvision.github.io/MolVision/</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Imaging; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

We introduce a Socratic agent for scientific reasoning, implemented through a structured system prompt that guides LLMs via classical principles of inquiry. Unlike typical prompt engineering or retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages definition, analogy, hypothesis elimination, and other Socratic techniques to generate more coherent, critical, and domain-aware responses. We evaluate the agent across diverse scientific domains and benchmark it on the ARC Challenge dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance (97.15%) without fine-tuning or external tools. Expert evaluation shows improved reasoning depth, clarity, and adaptability over conventional LLM outputs, suggesting that structured prompting rooted in philosophical reasoning can substantially enhance the scientific utility of language models.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68655d6fc1cb1ecda0b56de4/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}, {"title": "Full Prompt", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68655d871a8f9bdab5353e88/original/full-prompt.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This hierarchy enables systematic implementation of AI in practical chemistry, materials science, pharmaceuticals, catalytic technologies, environmental control, and other key areas. The first level contributes to increased efficiency in a wide range of tasks: in production, research and education, preparation of documentation, patent and market research, support of regulatory procedures, automated preparation of analytical data, as well as staff training and knowledge transfer within the organization. The second level provides in-depth data analysis, reduced R&D timelines, and technology scaling. The third level opens up opportunities for breakthrough solutions, including autonomous design of new molecules, processes, and materials. The development of each level requires appropriate infrastructure, training of personnel with interdisciplinary competencies and reliable support. The presented classification can serve as a basis for the formation of roadmaps for the digital transformation of chemical sciences, as well as for the implementation of scientific and technological development programs within the framework of priority areas. The term "technology-as-participant" is introduced for the first time as a designation of a new form of interaction between humans and AI, in which the digital system becomes an integral part of the scientific process, not just a tool.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Chemical Education; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Chemical sensors based on photonic crystals that use protein-catalyzed capture (PCC) agents as molecular sensors are promising tools for portable detection of chemical and biological compounds. We present the development and deployment of a high-throughput virtual screening protocol to computationally identify PCC candidates that maximize binding sensitivity and selectivity for fentanyl. The approach integrates enhanced sampling molecular dynamics free energy calculations, Gaussian process regression surrogate models, and Bayesian optimization to efficiently navigate the design space of over a million PCC candidates, resolve the sensitivity-selectivity Pareto frontier, and identify the top-performing PCC candidates. We analyze the molecular interactions between our top candidates and fentanyl target to propose design rules for high-performance PCC agents to be used for experimental testing, and, ultimately, incorporation into next-generation hydrogel-nanoparticle-based chemical sensing devices.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Thermodynamics (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686d7013728bf9025e69a3cc/original/supporting-information.pdf"}, {"title": "S1.csv", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686d708fe1957b8c61d3f53b/original/s1-csv.csv"}, {"title": "S2.json", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686d70c7728bf9025e69b39b/original/s2-json.JSON"}]</p></details> |

As a demonstration of the utility of our novel algorithm, reparameterizations for MNDO and AM1 using 1,187 CHNO molecules in the PM7 training set are reported and compared to analogous results obtained from the PARAM program used in development of the PMx models.  Our AM1 reparameterization yielded unexpectedly large improvements, and our findings indicate that derived geometrical reference functions are ill-suited for parameter optimization and may also inadvertently incentivize smaller force constants for chemical bonds. Together, these results suggest that judicious parameter refinement could substantially enhance the performance of NDDO-descendant semiempirical models.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6868dbc11a8f9bdab5b8833a/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Computer- aided synthesis planning promises to improve the efficiency of chemistry and enable robot-assisted workflows, but there remains a gap in bridging computational tools with experimental execution due to the challenge of reaction condition prediction. The conditions used to carry out a reaction consist of qualitative details, such as the discrete identities of “above-the-arrow” agents (catalysts, additives, solvents, etc.) as well as quantitative details, such as temperature and concentrations of both reactants (product contributing) and agents. These procedural aspects of organic chemistry exert a direct influence over the outcome of a chemical transformation and must be provided in any hypothetical autonomous synthesis workflow. In this work, we push beyond qualitative reaction condition recommendation by developing a data-driven framework that incorporates quantitative details, specifically equivalence ratios. We frame the condition recommendation problem as four sub-tasks: predicting agent identities, reaction temperature, reactant amounts, and agent amounts, and evaluate our model accordingly. We demonstrate improved performance over popularity and nearest neighbor baselines and highlight the model’s practical utility for predicting conditions in diverse reaction classes via representative case studies.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68680cfbc1cb1ecda0215ded/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Despite their modular structure, accurately identifying and annotating these components in PROTACs is challenging and typically relies on manual curation and predefined substructure matching. To address this, we developed PROTAC-Splitter, a machine learning framework designed for automated annotation of PROTAC substructures. To address data scarcity, we generated and openly released a synthetic dataset containing approximately 1.3 million PROTAC structures with annotated ligand splits. Leveraging this dataset, we developed two complementary approaches for PROTAC substructure annotation: a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model and a graph-based XGBoost model. We evaluated both approaches on held-out public data and structurally novel PROTACs from AstraZeneca's proprietary collection. The Transformer-based model achieved high exact-match accuracy (86%) on public data but dropped significantly (18%) on structurally novel internal PROTACs due to occasional hallucinations. In contrast, the XGBoost model can ensure chemical validity and perfect reassembly accuracy on both sets, with lower exact-match accuracy on open-data (49%) but comparable performance on the internal set (23%). To improve reliability, we implemented a wrapper function for the Transformer (Transformer-Delta), which corrects partial prediction errors, raising reassembly accuracy to 96% on public and 70% on internal datasets. Combining the strengths of both models, we propose a hybrid approach that reliably annotates PROTACs across diverse chemical spaces. PROTAC-Splitter provides a robust, scalable tool to facilitate automated PROTAC analysis and is available open-source at https://github.com/ribesstefano/PROTAC-Splitter.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

However, accurately and efficiently estimating enzyme activity is a challenge, because in general, precise methods are too computationally expensive. Here, we demonstrate that enzyme catalysis can be captured by coupling efficient machine-learned potentials (MLPs) for a reaction to the wider enzyme environment using electrostatic machine-learning embedding (EMLE). Our EMLE model is first applied to the natural Diels-Alderase AbyU, showing that it correctly differentiates the catalytic action on different enzyme-substrate conformations. Then, we show that training a reaction-specific EMLE model allows us to accurately capture the enzyme catalytic effects of the conversion of chorismate to prephenate, a reaction with a highly polarizable and charged transition state. In both cases, in contrast to mechanical embedding approaches, EMLE embedding allows accurate and efficient predictions of enzyme activity, agreeing with high-level QM/MM reference calculations. This approach facilitates the use of gas phase-trained MLPs in MLP/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) simulations and should thus be highly beneficial for computational activity screening of enzyme biocatalysts.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6866538b3ba0887c336493ad/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Transition metal complex (TMC) chromophores can push this field forward but their design is challenged by the need for optimizing multiple properties. An ideal chromophore would exhibit both intense and broad absorption in the visible range of the spectrum as well as, from a green chemistry perspective, high solubility in polar solvents including water. We hereby present a computational, data-driven approach to the discovery of novel TMC chromophores based on an evolutionary machine learning method combining elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and evolutionary computing (EC). In particular, AI-made bidentate ligands generated by a variational autoencoder were leveraged with an EC genetic algorithm (GA) for the multiobjective optimization of [RuL3]2+ chromophores. The fitness of the hits was consistent with intense, broad-spectrum absorption, and high solubility in polar solvents. The evolution of the absorption spectrum could be monitored step by step and easily interpreted by analyzing the frequency with which the ligands were selected by the GA. Based on the results, we suggest a set of experiments to the community doing wet lab research in this field.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Energy; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Photovoltaics | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686660801a8f9bdab55fefa4/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Besides the nature of the data and the models, ML performance is strongly dependent on the MOF representation. In this work, we extended the molecular atom-atom, bond-bond, bond-atom (AABBA) autocorrelations to generate vector representations of MOFs for ML models. AABBA vectors encoded both the atomic and bond properties of the MOF metal nodes and linkers, enhancing accuracy in the prediction of gas storage properties. In particular, we computed the gravimetric and volumetric adsorption capacities for the adsorption of hydrogen into 11,500 MOFs. The data, which is made openly available together with the ML models code, was computed with Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations to train neural networks predicting the isothermal hydrogen deliverable capacity at room temperature.

Recently, the PPD transformation product N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N’-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone (6PPDQ) has been identified in roadway runoff as a potent toxicant for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). As 6PPD may be phased out in favour of alternative PPDs, understanding the physicochemical properties of their corresponding quinones is important for predicting their environmental fate, distribution, and toxicity. Here, we present an experimentally determined log KOW for 6PPDQ (4.0 ± 0.2) as well as water solubility values for 6PPDQ and five structural analogues (3.2 – 170 µg/L). The water solubilities were several orders of magnitude lower than those predicted by EPI Suite and OPERA, popular Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) programs. We also report octanol-water and air-water partition ratios for PPDQs using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and QSAR approaches. Both methods provided similar rank ordering of compounds. We found that DFT tends to underestimate log KOW values, while QSAR models provide a better agreement with experimental results. Conversely, QSAR models provided poorer predictions of log KAW values than DFT. We discuss the strengths and limitations of both computational approaches, the need for more experimentally derived values, and caution researchers interpreting predicted physicochemical properties, particularly for emerging contaminants for which QSARs may be insufficiently parameterized. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6865b5a11a8f9bdab543cf53/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The model provides a description of charge-density-redistribution within the metal surface upon adsorption, which agrees well with an experimentally-derived CO-CO interaction potential on the Pt(111) surface. It allows for the definition of an embedding potential for relatively small metallic surface cuts that permits accurate prediction of the adsorption site preference of CO at Pt(111) surface with an arbitrary method of choice available for gas-phase calculations. We demonstrate that once embedding is applied, correct adsorption site preference can be recovered already with the well-known Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation density functional (PBE). The method provides open-boundary treatment for metallic systems that have not been described in the literature to date. The framework is applicable to any system with smeared electron density and has a wide range of applicability, with STM images generation and adsorption site preference determination being two examples explored in the current work.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Surface | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Computational approaches usually invoke a harmonic treatment of the vibrational modes for zero-point energies, as well as thermal and entropic contributions.  Herein, we present a general protocol for relative pKa prediction that incorporates the significant anharmonic effects using nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) theory. This protocol is validated against experimental data for a range of molecules in acetonitrile, including protonated nitrogen bases, nitrophenols, anilines, and diamines, as well as cobalt electrocatalysts. For simple acids, the NEO approach offers only a slight improvement over conventional density functional theory with the standard harmonic vibrational treatment, whereas for hydrogen-bonded acids, the NEO approach offers more significantly improved performance at a comparable computational cost. This methodology provides a practical route for accurate pKa prediction in challenging systems and is extendable to related thermodynamic properties such as hydricities and proton-coupled redox potentials.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686c28ac1a8f9bdab51014d0/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This concept has led to observations such as magneto-chiral dichroism and chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). However, being small, these effects often require additional amplification procedures such as flow chemistry to achieve bulk enantioseparation. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnetic field effect on photogenerated radical pairs, which also breaks time-reversal symmetry, can be harnessed for enantiopurification. Fundamental to this process is the collective decay of the singlet and triplet radical-pair states made possible by an applied magnetic field. Because opposite enantiomers exhibit spin-orbit coupling matrix elements of opposite signs, the singlet and triplet decay channels interfere constructively in one enantiomer. Meanwhile, molecules of the other enantiomer are funnelled into the first enantiomer through excited-state chirality inversion, achieving chiral resolution. Using an axially chiral binaphthyl derivative and a borane photosensitiser as prototype, we predict an appreciable enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 90% to be possible at steady state, attained within hundreds of milliseconds when irradiated by a laser. Importantly, our analytical results showcase regimes of perfect enantioselectivity (100% e.e.), accessible by further chemical optimisation of the photosensitiser for which general strategies are discussed. Overall, this work illustrates a so-far untapped but powerful control knob for photoredox catalysis based on spin chemistry principles.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Photocatalysis; Redox Catalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686b9432c1cb1ecda083256d/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This paper investigates the photophysical properties of oligo-p-phenylenes (OPP-n), with a focus on p-terphenyl (OPP-3), and their functionalized derivatives to identify structural features that may enhance their photocatalytic potential.  We examine how symmetric and asymmetric terminal substitutions affect excitation energies, oscillator strengths, exciton characteristics, and fluorescence. Our results show that push–pull derivatives have significantly lower excitation energies and larger oscillator strengths, promoting efficient radical anion generation. These derivatives also exhibit longer fluorescence lifetimes, which may improve the probability of productive interactions with sacrificial electron donors. Exciton analysis reveals that asymmetric substitutions introduce charge-transfer character, whereas higher oligomers maintain tightly bound excitons with limited delocalization. Overall, functionalized OPP-n chromophores, especially push–pull derivatives of OPP-3, demonstrate favorable optical and excitonic properties for photoredox catalysis, making them promising candidates for CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution applications.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Photocatalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Photophysical properties of functionalized terphenyls and implications to photoredox catalysis", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/686575f03ba0887c333cfa06/original/photophysical-properties-of-functionalized-terphenyls-and-implications-to-photoredox-catalysis.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here, we synthesized an extensive library of arylazo-1,3,5-trimethylpyrazole photoswitches and rationalized the influence of para-substituents on the thermal half-lives, finding excellent agreement between calculated and measured trends. Calculations show that the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents modulates the back-isomerization process through at least two distinct mechanisms. Strong electron-donating groups enhance delocalization at the azo moiety and thus favour a nonadiabatic out-of-plane rotational pathway via the lowest triplet state. In contrast, strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce delocalization and promote a conventional ground state in-plane inversion mechanism. Intermediate substituents exhibit a gradual shift that combines both major mechanisms. These findings provide prospects for rational design of responsive photoswitches with controllable thermal stability, essential for in vivo applications.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Photochemistry (Org.); Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information for \"Mechanistic Insight into para-Substituent Control of Thermal Half-Lives in Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches\"", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68652d1b1a8f9bdab5307fdd/original/supporting-information-for-mechanistic-insight-into-para-substituent-control-of-thermal-half-lives-in-arylazopyrazole-photoswitches.pdf"}]</p></details> |
