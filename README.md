| **[Expanding Molecular Design with Graph Variational Autoencoders: A Comparative Study of Pair-Encoding and Character Tokenization](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6829051ee561f77ed46d15e9/original/expanding-molecular-design-with-graph-variational-autoencoders-a-comparative-study-of-pair-encoding-and-character-tokenization.pdf)** | 2025-05-23 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j1p93 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models are transforming early-stage drug discovery, yet most current approaches are not well suited for realistic, small-data settings and often rely on simplified molecular representations such as linear strings, overlooking the inherent graph-based structure of molecules. To address this, we first developed the Transformer Graph Variational Autoencoder (TGVAE), an AI model that learns directly from molecular graphs and generates Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. Building upon this foundation, here we introduce the improved architecture of TGVAE (TGVAEv2) and a DeeperGAT-VAE (DGVAE) model, an upgraded architecture that incorporates lightweight and deeper graph-attention blocks, designed to enable future applications on smaller molecular datasets. Both models address common challenges in training, such as over-smoothing in graph neural networks and posterior collapse in VAEs, ensuring stable and chemically precise molecule generation. Across standard benchmarks, TGVAEv2 and DGVAE achieve high validity, uniqueness, diversity, and novelty, while reproducing key drug-like property distributions. In addition to architectural improvements, we also expanded the input tokenization by incorporating SMILES pair-encoding, which captures larger and chemically relevant substructures compared to character-level tokens and supports the generation of more diverse and novel molecules. By comparing both approaches, we present how the DGVAE can achieve improved performance with fewer parameters and faster convergence while maintaining chemical accuracy. Evaluation against PubChem confirms that SMILES pair-encoding greatly expands the space of scaffolds and fragments unseen in public databases. These advancements not only broaden the accessible chemical space but also set a new benchmark for the application of graph-based AI models in molecular generation and drug discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Despite advances in ML tools for both strategies, screening remains bounded by time and computational cost, while generative models frequently produce invalid and synthetically inaccessible molecules. Screening time can be improved with pharmacophore search, which quickly identifies ligands in a database that match a pharmacophore query. In this work, we introduce PharmacoForge, a diffusion model for generating 3D pharmacophores conditioned on a protein pocket. Generated pharmacophore queries identify ligands that are guaranteed to be valid, commercially available molecules. We evaluate PharmacoForge against ligand generative models through a docking-based evaluation framework and assess pharmacophore quality with enrichment factor metrics when virtual screening the DUD-E dataset. Resulting ligands from pharmacophore queries performed similarly to de novo generated ligands when docking to DUD-E targets and had lower strain energies compared to de novo generated ligands.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

We utilize ab initio information from the quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM) for 60k transition metal complexes at multiple levels of theory (LOT), presented here in the tmQM+ dataset, to inform flexible graph neural network (GNN) models. We evaluate these models with several experiments, including training on limited charge and elemental compositions 1 and testing on unseen charges and elements, as well as training on smaller portions of the dataset. Results show that additional quantum chemical information improves performance on unseen regimes and smaller training sets. Furthermore, we leverage the tmQM+ dataset to analyze how QTAIM descriptors vary across different LOT and probe machine learning performance with less computationally expensive LOT. We determine that ab initio descriptors provide benefits across LOT, thereby motivating the use of lower-level DFT descriptors, particularly for predicting expensive or experimental molecular properties.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

We present MDtrajNet-1, a foundational AI model that directly generates MD trajectories across chemical space, bypassing force calculations and integration. This approach accelerates simulations by up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional MD, even those enhanced by machine-learning interatomic potentials. MDtrajNet-1 combines equivariant neural networks with a Transformer-based architecture to achieve strong accuracy and transferability in predicting long-time trajectories for both known and unseen systems. Remarkably, the errors of the trajectories generated by MDtrajNet-1 for various molecular systems are close to those of the conventional ab initio MD. The model’s flexible design supports diverse application scenarios, including different statistical ensembles, boundary conditions, and interaction types. By overcoming the intrinsic speed barrier of conventional MD, MDtrajNet-1 opens new frontiers in efficient and scalable atomistic simulations.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

While artificial intelligence tools have shown promise in predicting reaction conditions, including solvent selection, they often overlook sustainability criteria in their recommendations and lack experimental validation. In this work, we present data-driven machine learning models for solvent prediction for organic reactions. Building on these models' ability to capture chemical similarity in their learned representations, we developed a green solvent replacement methodology that adapts to evolving sustainability standards without requiring model retraining. Our models achieve a Top-3 accuracy of 85.1% in predicting missing solvents for patent-derived reactions, demonstrating excellent performance even for underrepresented solvent classes. Through uncertainty analysis, we found that model misclassifications correlated with reactions that could be carried out in multiple solvents. We validated our approach experimentally, achieving a 88% success rate for general solvent prediction and a 80% success rate when focusing on green solvent alternatives. Our work addresses a key challenge in organic synthesis and provides a practical methodology for predicting both conventional and sustainable solvents for organic synthesis.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Rule-based pipelines and early large language model (LLM) workflows are often constrained by shallow context windows and limited coverage of multi-section and cross-referenced data which is important for catalyst design and operation. We introduce CATDA (Corpus-aware Automated Text-to-Graph Catalyst Discovery Agent), an integrated framework that unifies LLM reasoning for formatted dataset curation and knowledge discovery. CatGraph is presented as a unified graph representation that captures multistep synthesis pathways, precursor properties, catalytic performance, and experimental conditions, extracted from full-text documents using the longest context window to date. Based on this structured graph, two downstream agents are further developed: CatAgent, which enables natural-language queries and DatasetAgent, which exports machine-learning-ready datasets. On our benchmark, the extracted datasets achieve near-human fidelity (F1 > 0.97), demonstrating the accuracy of our pipeline. Together, these tools form an integrated system that connects literature mining, knowledge discovery, and predictive modeling – supporting data-driven catalyst design and synthesis operation optimization for next-generation inorganic catalysts.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6826cb19e561f77ed41d9b80/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Raman spectra from SMILES representations](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68263e1f50018ac7c5659c45/original/mol2raman-a-graph-neural-network-model-for-predicting-raman-spectra-from-smiles-representations.pdf)** | 2025-05-19 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-67395 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for probing molecular vibrations, yet the computational
prediction of Raman spectra remains challenging due to the high cost of quantum chemical methods
and the complexity of structure-spectrum relationships. Here, we introduce Mol2Raman, a deeplearning
framework that predicts spontaneous Raman spectra directly from SMILES representations
of molecules. The model leverages Graph Isomorphism Networks with edge features (GINE) to encode
molecular topology and bond characteristics, enabling accurate prediction of both peak positions and
intensities across diverse chemical structures. Trained on a novel dataset of over 31,000 molecules
with state of the art Density Functional Theory (DFT)-calculated Raman spectra, Mol2Raman outperforms
both fingerprint-based similarity models and Chemprop-based neural networks. It achieves
a high fidelity in reproducing spectral features, including for molecules with low structural similarity
to the training set and for enantiomeric inversion. The model offers fast inference times (22
ms per molecule), making it suitable for high-throughput molecular screening. We further deploy
Mol2Raman as an open-access web application, enabling real-time predictions without specialized
hardware. This work establishes a scalable, accurate, and interpretable platform for Raman spectral
prediction, opening new opportunities in molecular design, materials discovery, and spectroscopic
diagnostics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Informations", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/682642ae50018ac7c565fd9a/original/supplementary-informations.pdf"}]</p></details> |
| **[A Structure-Based Approach for Predicting Odor Similarity of Molecules via Docking Simulations with Human Olfactory Receptors](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/681eae8150018ac7c5412289/original/a-structure-based-approach-for-predicting-odor-similarity-of-molecules-via-docking-simulations-with-human-olfactory-receptors.pdf)** | 2025-05-19 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fhthr | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mechanisms underlying human odor recognition remain largely unclear, making it challenging to predict the scent of a novel molecule based solely on its molecular structure. Unlike taste, which is classified into a limited number of categories, odor perception is highly complex and lacks universally defined labels, rendering absolute odor classification inherently ambiguous. To address this issue, we propose a relative evaluation framework for odor prediction, focusing on odor similarity rather than absolute descriptors. In this study, we constructed three-dimensional structures of approximately 400 human olfactory receptors (hORs) using AlphaFold2 and performed molecular docking simulations with odorant compounds. Each odorant was represented as a 409-dimensional docking score vector, and odor similarity was inferred by comparing these vectors statistically. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we used odorant molecules from the ATLAS database and tested whether molecules with similar docking profiles correspond to similar olfactory perceptions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed docking-based method enables the relative prediction of odor similarity between molecules, even for compounds not included in the reference database. This method offers a promising alternative to traditional QSAR-based approaches relying solely on structural similarity, and provides a structure-based, receptor-level framework for computational olfaction.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Biochemistry; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information for \"A Structure-Based Approach for Predicting Odor Similarity of Molecules via Docking Simulations with Human Olfactory Receptors\"", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/682467f1e561f77ed4bfe736/original/supporting-information-for-a-structure-based-approach-for-predicting-odor-similarity-of-molecules-via-docking-simulations-with-human-olfactory-receptors.pdf"}]</p></details> |
| **[Molecular Docking, Machine Learning-Guided Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Novel Multitarget HDAC/ROCK Inhibitors](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/682c8b293ba0887c33dd1404/original/molecular-docking-machine-learning-guided-design-synthesis-and-biological-evaluation-of-novel-multitarget-hdac-rock-inhibitors.pdf)** | 2025-05-22 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xhmlv | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinases (ROCKs) are critical regulators of tumor development, progression and immunomodulation, particularly in aggressive cancers such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Previous in silico and in vitro studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of multitarget HDAC/ROCK inhibition, leading to the identification of C-9 as the first-in-class multitarget HDAC/ROCK inhibitor. In the present study, C-9 served as a lead compound for the rational design of a new series of multitarget inhibitors.
Structure-based drug design (SBDD) was used to develop a series of novel HDAC/ROCK multitarget inhibitors. Molecular docking and MM-GBSA binding free energy analysis confirmed strong and specific interactions with the catalytic sites of both targets. Based on these computational insights, ten compounds were synthesized and biologically evaluated using enzyme inhibition and cancer cell assays. Among the synthesized compounds, C-35 and C-40 showed remarkable cytotoxic activity against TNBC cell lines, with IC50 values of 17 µM and 27 µM against MDA-MB-231 cells and about 35 µM against MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively, outperforming known selective HDAC6 and ROCK inhibitors such as tubastatin A and fasudil. Further mechanistic studies revealed that these compounds induce early apoptosis, arrest cell cycle progression and downregulate PD-L1 expression. Remarkably, C-35 also increased the expression of MICA in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, possibly promoting the recognition and elimination of tumor cells by immune cells.
To further support rational drug optimization, we used synthesized compounds and their IC50 values for the enzymes to form an external blind validation set that enabled the development of machine learning-based quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) models for HDAC6 and ROCK2. These models, developed for the first time for both targets, showed strong predictive performance and were integrated into a comprehensive CADD workflow combining structure-based (molecular docking and MM-GBSA) and ligand-based (QSAR) methods for drug development.
Overall, this study highlights the anti-cancer, anti-invasive, anti-migratory and immunomodulatory potential of multitarget HDAC/ROCK inhibition for the treatment of TNBC. Finally, it creates a robust computational-experimental pipeline for future development and optimization of multitarget HDAC/ROCK inhibitors.

Herein, we present an updated, publicly accessible database of 100 neutral 7e-4c boryl radicals, each parametrized by a set of electronic and steric features derived from DFT calculations. Unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering) and dimensionality reduction (PCA / t-SNE) condense this high-dimensional descriptor space into the “B-rad map,” visually capturing trends in steric and electronics among the resulting five clusters. Global electrophilicity (ω) and nucleophilicity (N) indices are overlaid to create a polarity‑annotated guide, while DFT‑computed activation free energies for six benchmark reactions (HAT, radical addition, XAT for two different substrates) yield React‑B‑rad maps that directly link intrinsic properties to specific reaction performance. These maps might be used as a practical guideline to decide on experimental setups for boryl radical mediated transformations. To demonstrate predictive power, supervised machine learning models (random forest) trained on the descriptors are able to forecast activation barriers with reasonable accuracy (3-6 kcal·mol-1), despite the diversity of the reaction space. Overall, this integrated, machine-learning-driven platform can serve as both a practical guide for experimental decision-making and a foundation for data-driven discovery, paving the way towards rational design and virtual screening of boryl-radical reagents for diverse synthetic applications.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Similar mechanisms are also fundamental to biological systems, including enzyme catalysis and cellular signaling. At sub-nanometer scales, confinement and interfacial interactions dramatically reshape the molecular landscape, challenging conventional assumptions about pH and chemical reactivity. Here, we combine density-corrected density functional theory with machine-learned interatomic potentials to investigate the autoionization of water confined to quasi-two-dimensional monolayers within sub-nanometer slit pores. We find that extreme confinement markedly suppresses water autoionization, raising the effective pKw by more than two units. This suppression originates from hydroxide ion destabilization at interfaces, driven by restricted hydrogen bonding, hindered molecular reorientation, and a breakdown of Grotthuss proton transport caused by topological frustration in the hydrogen-bond network. These findings offer a molecular-level understanding of how confinement modulates fundamental aqueous chemistry and establish guiding principles for tuning pH-dependent reactivity in nanoscale environments.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Materials Science; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68279fc650018ac7c594e37d/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This study demonstrates that pesticide vapour pressures can be predicted (77.1% within one order of magnitude) using kernel ridge regression on quantum chemical molecular properties but the model lacks interpretability. However, insights (via Shapley additive explanations) can be gained when a framework of functional groups is employed instead. A functional group-based model (66.7% within one order of magnitude) reveals that aromatic compounds, sulfonic acid derivatives, and carboxylic acid derivatives influence the vapour pressure the most. SHAP value trends indicate a linear relationship between reduced vapour pressure and the frequency of functional groups. A provided list of functional group contributions enables molecular modifications to optimise pesticide vapour pressures.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Earth, Space, and Environmental Chemistry; Environmental Science; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: Use of functional groups for vapour pressure prediction of pesticides", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68270ba650018ac7c57fce4e/original/supporting-information-use-of-functional-groups-for-vapour-pressure-prediction-of-pesticides.pdf"}, {"title": "Functional group composition", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68270bfae561f77ed4266d41/original/functional-group-composition.csv"}]</p></details> |

Self-healing polymers based on thermally reversible Diels-Alder (DA) reactions offer a potential solution by enabling heating controlled repair through bond-breaking and reformation. However, discovering new suitable DA monomer combinations has largely relied on intuition and trial-and-error so far. Here, we present a hierarchical workflow that integrates machine learning (ML) with automated reaction profile calculations to efficiently screen DA reactions for self-healing polymer applications. Using our in-house TS-tools software, we generate high-throughput profiles at the semi-empirical xTB level. Refining only a small fraction with DFT, we are able to train a robust ML model that predicts reaction characteristics with excellent accuracy. Adding a graph-based ML model to the workflow for pre-screening enables expansion to reaction spaces of hundreds of thousands of reactions, at a marginal cost. We first leverage our models to screen a comprehensive reaction space of synthetic diene-dienophile pairs, and subsequently use them to mine a database of commercially available natural products. Overall, this hybrid ML–computational chemistry approach enables data-efficient discovery of thermally responsive DA reactions, advancing the rational design of self-healing polymers with tunable properties.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68222d0ee561f77ed4565f6a/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This approach overcomes the problem of data inconsistencies in the training of machine learning models on atomistic data. We rephrase the underlying problem as a multi-task learning scenario. We show that conditioning neural network-based models on trainable embedding vectors can effectively account for quantitative differences between methods. This allows for joint training on multiple datasets that would otherwise be incompatible. Therefore, this procedure circumvents the need for re-computations at a unified level of theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that training on multiple reference methods enables transfer learning between tasks, resulting in even lower errors compared to training on separate tasks alone. Furthermore, we show that this approach can be used for multi-fidelity learning, improving data efficiency for the highest fidelity by an order of magnitude. To test scalability, we train a single model on a joint dataset compiled from 10 disjoint subsets of the MultiXC-QM9 dataset generated by different reference methods. Again, we observe transfer learning effects that improve the model errors by a factor of 2 compared to training on each subset alone. We extend our investigation to machine learning force fields for material simulations. To this end, we incorporate trainable embedding vectors into the readout layer of a deep graph neural network (M3GNet) that is simultaneously trained on PBE and r2SCAN labels of the MatPES dataset. We observe that joint training on both fidelity levels reduces the amount of r2SCAN data required to achieve the accuracy of a single-fidelity model by a factor of 10.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

It cultivates key skills in molecular modeling and data analysis while offering students insights into fundamental organic concepts like stereoselectivity, steric effects, and electronic effects. Implemented as a capstone project in advanced organic chemistry courses, this project effectively introduces theoretical concepts of intermolecular interactions, and provides a practical and easy way for teaching catalytic mechanisms.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Chemical Education; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Organocatalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Students\u2019 Handouts Organic Section", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/682ddf6c1a8f9bdab50aa4f7/original/students-handouts-organic-section.docx"}, {"title": "Students\u2019 Handouts Computational Section", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/682ddff0c1cb1ecda090ca44/original/students-handouts-computational-section.docx"}, {"title": "Input and output files for computational part", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/682de02b3ba0887c3310138c/original/input-and-output-files-for-computational-part.docx"}, {"title": "Reagents and instruments for the organic experiment, 1H-NMR spectrum and HPLC spectrum of the product synthesized in different solvents", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/682de0563ba0887c331019e4/original/reagents-and-instruments-for-the-organic-experiment-1h-nmr-spectrum-and-hplc-spectrum-of-the-product-synthesized-in-different-solvents.docx"}, {"title": "Detailed computational results", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/682de078c1cb1ecda090dcad/original/detailed-computational-results.docx"}]</p></details> |

In particular, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) induced dissociative photoionization of 2-thiouracil (2-TU) has been recently studied using synchrotron radiation [Robinson et al., Molecules 2023, 28, 2354]. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations at the semiempirical OM2 level, we study fragmentation dynamics of the cations of 2-TU and its isomer, 4-thiouracil (4-TU). Considering various VUV photon energies, we calculate energy-resolved mass spectra and breakdown diagrams for 2-TU and 4-TU. Remarkably, we find that the major fragments are different among the two compounds — 69 amu (C3NH3O+) for 2-TU, and 85 amu (C3NH3S+) for 4-TU. Our simulations provide direct mechanistic insight into this observation and in fragmentation processes of the thionated uracils in general.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6825974ae561f77ed4efcb02/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This work offers a perspective on how electrostatic interactions influence the 2PA response of fluorescent protein (FP) chromophores, demonstrating the role of their surrounding environment in modulating 2PA optical properties. In this work, we present electrostatic tuning maps, created by placing partial charges along the Van der Waals radii of eight different chromophores: Green FP (neutral and anion), Red FP (neutral and anion), mBlueberry FP, Kusabira orange FP, and two non-canonical chromophores, a hydroxyquinolone derivative, and the chromophore of Gold FP. 2PA cross sections (σ2PA) were calculated at the CAM-B3LYP(D3BJ)/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. The results show that the influence of point charges varies with their location, leading to substantial increases or decreases in the obtained σ2PA. Upon initial investigation, neutral chromophores tend to increase their σ2PA when positive point charges are present close to the imidazolinone group, while lowering their σ2PA when they are present near the benzylidene ring. In contrast, anionic species show an opposite trend. Using a positive or negative point charge has the opposite effect as well, increasing or decreasing σ2PA by relatively the same amount. These maps aid in understanding how electrostatic interactions influence 2PA responses, providing a framework for guiding structural modifications to the protein environment as well as the design and optimization of 2PA probes.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary_info.pdf", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6824b76550018ac7c526001c/original/supplementary-info-pdf.pdf"}, {"title": "master_points.xlsx", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6824b7b650018ac7c5260813/original/master-points-xlsx.xlsx"}, {"title": "2SM.xlsx", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6824b7d950018ac7c5260cfe/original/2sm-xlsx.xlsx"}]</p></details> |
