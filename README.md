Inferring these directly from 2D reaction graphs offers chemists a powerful tool for rapid and accessible reaction analysis. Quantum chemical methods for computing TSs are computationally intensive and often infeasible for larger molecular systems. Recently, deep learning–based diffusion models have shown promise in generating TSs from 2D reaction graphs for single-step reactions. However, framing TS generation as a diffusion process, by design, requires a prohibitively large number of sampling steps during inference. Here we show that modeling TS generation as an optimal transport flow problem, solved via E(3)-equivariant flow matching with geometric tensor networks, achieves over a hundredfold speedup in inference while improving geometric accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. This breakthrough increase in sampling efficiency and predictive accuracy enables the practical use of deep learning-based TS generators in high-throughput settings for larger and more complex chemical systems. Our method, GoFlow, thus represents a significant methodological advancement in machine learning-based TS generation, bringing it closer to widespread use in computational chemistry workflows.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e3e7dbbc2ac3a0e09fd227/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Molecules on a Single Robotic Platform](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68de33daf2aff167708137a8/original/thinking-outside-the-library-cluster-synthesis-of-diverse-molecules-on-a-single-robotic-platform.pdf)** | 2025-10-08 | 10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j8bsl | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of a general autonomous platform for organic synthesis that enables faster, flexible and efficient delivery of target molecules is an attractive strategy for many fields such as drug discovery and material sciences. Traditionally, automated parallel synthesis relies on the synthesis of libraries of various sizes, sharing the same transformations and name reactions with defined reaction conditions. Herein, we report on the development of our platform and a paradigm shift in high throughput robotic synthesis: from mono-reaction type libraries to multi-reaction type clusters. This fundamentally distinct approach differs from the current strategies by clustering reactions based on their reaction conditions, defined as ranges of acceptable temperature and time by expert chemists. As a result, many different reactivities can be merged in a cluster. An algorithm has been developed to help chemists organize the workload in the minimum number of clusters taking into account the physical and chemical constraints of the platform. We applied this strategy to organize efficiently the synthesis of 135 molecules, using 27 different name reactions in only 6 clusters and 3 synthetic campaigns.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information 251002", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68de473ff4163037703de17b/original/supporting-information-251002.pdf"}, {"title": "Supporting information - Annexes", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68de48bb3e708a764935d4c6/original/supporting-information-annexes.zip"}, {"title": "Supporting information - Analysis data", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68de49693e708a764935ec06/original/supporting-information-analysis-data.zip"}]</p></details> |

Achieving this requires imaging platforms capable of resolving both structural evolution and chemical specificity, non-invasively and in real time. Digital off-axis holography (DOAH) has emerged as a powerful, label-free technique for high-resolution quantitative phase imaging for monitoring chemical changes in solution and at solid–liquid–gas interfaces. However, DOAH inherently lacks chemical specificity, limiting their applicability to distinguish ionic species or map compositional gradients. Recent developments in multimodal holography combining DOAH with spectroscopic modalities such as fluorescence or Raman offer chemically sensitive imaging capabilities, but introduce challenges in data fusion, temporal synchronization, and computational throughput. In parallel, artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping DOAH with state-of-the-art models combining physics-based modules with data-driven neural networks to deliver fast and interpretable reconstructions. Here, we present a conceptual framework for intelligent multimodal holography that leverages physics-informed machine learning to enable sparse, adaptive acquisition and real-time chemical-structural inference. Collectively, these developments open new possibilities for employing DOAH in situ imaging across chemical separations and interfacial science. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry - General; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a hybrid framework for binding affinity prediction that combines pharmacophoric maps of the protein binding site with a graph-based representation of the ligand. Our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models while offering enhanced interpretability through attribution methods. This work demonstrates the potential of interpretable pharmacophoric representations in deep learning and provides a valuable tool for structure-based drug discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e37dafbc2ac3a0e09522b1/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The “black box” nature of these ML models, however, remains a significant barrier between predictions and the design of novel MOFs. In this work, we introduce PoroNet, an inherently interpretable graph neural network architecture built on a graph representation of the pore network (i.e., pore graph). In a pore graph, nodes represent individual pores and edges represent pore connections. PoroNet shows highly accurate predictions of hydrogen (H2) uptake and deliverable capacity in MOFs, as well as on a benchmark simulated adsorption dataset that contains spherical and linear alkane adsorbates. More importantly, accurate pore-level contributions to adsorption can be learned using PoroNet through both direct supervised learning and as emergent properties while fitting the total adsorption capacity. In the direct supervised learning, we show that PoroNet is data-efficient in some cases, achieving comparable performance to the standard approach with only a fraction of simulation runs needed for model training. The pore-level contribution helps interpret the ML predictions of the total adsorption behavior, identify the key pore properties that govern the adsorption, and provide significant insights into pore engineering. We demonstrate that PoroNet is a powerful tool for high-throughput pore screening and for deriving valuable MOF design rules for cryogenic H2 storage applications. Lastly, we discuss the potential of leveraging interpretable ML for scalable scientific and material discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68df1c125dd091524f9fead8/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The system is built upon a foundational Large Lan- guage Model trained on a large comprehensive chemical database, capable of generating structurally diverse and synthetically accessible compounds. It is then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning to enhance its capacity to generate molecules tailored to specific biological targets. As a case study, we apply this platform to design molecules target- ing key proteins involved in Alzheimer’s Disease. The generated compounds underwent molecular docking studies to assess their binding affinities and prioritize candidates with optimal predicted interactions. The top-ranked molecules were further analyzed based on their binding modes and key molecular interactions with the target proteins. The results suggest that our generative model produces viable, drug-like molecules with  favorable interactions, underscoring its potential as a valuable tool in early-stage drug discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Bioorganic Chemistry; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary_material", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68dce2bff416303770171d25/original/supplementary-material.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN)–based scoring function that emphasizes the careful design of the training strategy over architectural complexity. Systematic evaluation of data augmentation strategies shows that random rotation, unlike commonly used 90-degree rotations, effectively mitigates rotational variance. We also introduce a simple regularization technique that reduces reliance on isolated protein or ligand features and, together with random rotation, promotes learning of meaningful intermolecular interaction patterns. The resulting model, built on a simple architecture, generalizes across diverse test conditions, including structurally disjoint splits, and matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods. Through systematic ablation studies and interpretability experiments, we provide insights into model behaviour, highlighting the importance of data-centric design in developing reliable scoring functions.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Designing next-generation catalysts requires an atomic-level understanding of the factors that affect the catalyst sulfur tolerance, but this is difficult to obtain due to complex interactions between the Ni catalyst and non-inert metal oxide supports. In this work, a combined computational and experimental approach is adopted to investigate design strategies for enhancing the sulfur tolerance of Ni catalysts via optimisation of the metal oxide support. We investigate the thermodynamic driving force for oxygen-mediated sulfur removal from the Ni(111) surface, which is indicative of the regenerative effects of support oxygen buffering, using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) sampling of a lattice model that is parameterised using density functional theory (DFT). The outcome is predictions of the surface coverage and composition of adsorbed S and O atoms across an extended Ni(111) surface, which are validated with a fine-tuned machine learned interatomic potential to reveal entropic contributions for catalyst regeneration at experimentally relevant surface coverages. Simulations of the surface chemistry of Ni(111) are complemented by predictions of the energetics of bulk defect formation in prototypical metal oxide support materials to provide insights into the proclivity for oxygen release and phase transformation during catalytic reactions. The computational modelling is correlated with experimental characterisation and methane steam reforming activity tests for H2S-poisoned Ni nanoparticle catalysts, allowing us to rationalise the experimentally observed differences in the catalyst sulfur tolerance and establish strategies for future catalyst optimisation. The work demonstrates the integration of ab initio computational modelling, statistical sampling and machine learning, in a combined framework that complements experimental characterisation, to inform the rational design of catalyst support materials for sustainable H2 production.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e66bbedfd0d042d179081f/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here, we extend the intramolecular MB‑nrg framework, previously developed for gas‑phase molecules, to simulate biomolecules in solution, using polyalanine in water as a proof‑of‑concept system.  By integrating machine-learned terms trained on DLPNO-CCSD(T) reference data with physics‑based expressions within the many‑body expansion of the energy, we develop an MB‑nrg PEF that simultaneously accounts for intramolecular interactions within polyalanine chains and intermolecular polyalanine--water interactions that shape the structure and dynamics of polyalanine in solution.  The MB-nrg PEF adopts a unified, modular architecture spanning both polyalanine and water. We evaluate the performance of the MB-nrg PEF by comparing interaction energies, conformational free‑energy surfaces, and hydration properties against DLPNO‑CCSD(T) reference data and empirical force fields.  These analyses demonstrate the transferability of the MB‑nrg formalism from the gas phase to aqueous environments for polypeptides, offering a scalable route toward chemically accurate biomolecular simulations.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Biophysics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e5c4c55dd091524f559624/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Given the ubiquity of water vapor in the environment, predicting water adsorption within MOFs is critical, but the classical force fields, such as the UFF, often fail. To overcome this problem, we propose a strategy to fine-tune a machine learning potential (MLP) from the pretrained MACE model for water adsorption within MOFs. We test our strategy on a dataset of 420 Al-MOFs with 439 distinct linkers. The fine-tuned model can predict heats of adsorption and Henry coefficients of six well-known Al-MOFs, in good agreement with experiments. We also show that these accurate predictions require not only the accurate description of MOF-H2O interactions but also the framework flexibility, which are missing in previous screening studies. From a case study on MIL-160, we established the accuracy thresholds of 8 kJ/mol on total energies and 50 meV/Å on atomic forces for heat of adsorption calculations, and our final model achieves it on 409 Al-MOFs. Using this model, we can escape the local minimum and obtain optimal configurations with significantly lower DFT-energy than DFT-optimized ones. To identify optimal MOFs for water harvesting, we also applied this model to calculate DFT-level heat of adsorption. Compared with these DFT-level results, UFF underestimates the heat of adsorption by more than 3.5 kJ/mol in 92.4\% of MOFs. Thus, our work demonstrates that the MLP can provide DFT-level predictions for high-throughput screening studies. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e4cbf6bc2ac3a0e0b1afa4/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Surpassing these limitations requires going beyond the static view of catalysis. Here, we propose 2D metal boride (MBene) as a promising model system for dynamic catalysis, exemplifying by nitrogen reduction reaction (\ce{N2}RR). The surface reactivity of B-rich MBene can be altered by binding organic ligands to the opposite side of the \ce{N2}RR. The change in reactivity originates in structural distortions of the metal and boron layers, leading to an energy span of up to 0.8 eV. By cycling the ligands or running a coupled reaction on the opposite side, we could switch between under- and over-binding energetics to surpass the Sabatier limit and access the inverse activity volcano. The reactivity space considering various metals and ligands can be efficiently explored by interpretable machine learning based on geometric descriptors, and promising ligand-bound MBenes for various catalytic scenarios are proposed.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e49c2f5dd091524f2ac16c/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

chemistry, particularly in complex systems where conventional methods struggle to identify optimal searching
directions. Here, we propose Loxodynamics, a machine-learning-driven approach for reaction exploration

dynamically determines low-energy barrier directions, efficiently guiding the system toward metastable states.
The core of our framework is Skewencoder, an autoencoder augmented with a skewness-based loss function that
extracts reaction coordinates from minimal sampling data. Through iterative sample-and-search cycles, the
system adaptively maps the free energy surface, capturing finite-temperature effects critical to complex reactive
environments. We validate our method across model potentials, gas-phase reactions (S_N 2 and Diels-Alder), and
catalytic alcohol dehydration in acidic chabazite under operando conditions. Loxodynamics offers a systematic

Successful routine implementation of such reactions is limited, due to the large number of chemical species at play, resulting in complex optimization tasks. The development of predictive models for these novel synthetic methodologies remains challenging due to limited experimental data availability. The integration of quantum-mechanics (QM) calculations with machine learning has proven effective for developing predictive models of complex reactions with sparse experimental data. Here, we present a quantum mechanics-machine learning (QM-ML) approach to predict the feasibility of dual-catalyzed nickel-photoredox cross-coupling reactions across four reaction subtypes: bromide cross-electrophile couplings, chloride cross-electrophile couplings, deoxygenative couplings, and amino radical transfer (ART) couplings. Random-Forest classification models are trained using DFT-computed descriptors and automated simulations outcomes alongside cheminformatics features.

It contains 20 independent Python scripts and Fortran programs, all with a unified and intuitive handling concept based on command line  arguments. A large repertoire of VASP calculations can be set up with some simple command line calls, including the generation and combination of POSCAR files for bulk and surface slab structures, the respective POTCAR and KPOINTS files and task-specific INCAR files. It further enables the management and evaluation of complex setups not covered by other utility scripts or programs so far, like split-up and parallelized frequency calculations for large structures, or the automated evaluation and visualization of core level energy or Bader partial charge calculations. Emphasis is made on surface-science related calculations, like the targeted placement of adsorbates on substrates or the visualization of scanning-tunneling microscope pictures. Finally, the generation and management of machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on VASP reference data is greatly simplified. Training data collected by on the fly learnings of VASP ML force fields can be effectively selected and combined, or exported into data formats used for Behler-Parrinello neural network or message-passing atomic cluster expansion (MACE) MLIPs.

These tools have enabled the inspection of structures, dynamics, and interactions, yet their reliance on two-dimensional (2D) interfaces imposes persistent limitations. Traditional screen–mouse systems are poorly suited to conveying the inherently three-dimensional (3D) nature of molecules, and thoughtful manipulation of structures remains cumbersome even for expert users. Such barriers are particularly acute for students and occasional users, for whom intuitive understanding is critical. Immersive technologies under the umbrella of eXtended Reality (XR)—including Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)—offer a paradigm shift. By situating molecules directly in 3D space, XR facilitates both perception and manipulation, making abstract concepts more tangible. Educational benefits include heightened engagement and improved spatial reasoning, while for research XR offers more fluid collaborative exploration of molecular systems. Historically, adoption was limited by expensive, bulky hardware and complex software installation. The WebXR standard now addresses these issues by enabling cross-platform immersive experiences directly through browsers, eliminating installation barriers and improving accessibility. The MolecularWeb ecosystem (https://molecularweb.org) exploits these advances to deliver immersive molecular graphics and modeling widely. Its first platform, moleculARweb, brings “commodity AR” to everyday devices such as laptops and smartphones. Using simple fiducial markers or markerless AR, students can view and manipulate molecular structures in real time. Modules cover orbitals, VSEPR geometries, hydrogen bonding, and biomolecular assemblies, while Virtual Modeling Kits provide rudimentary molecular mechanics. Teachers report that these activities improve engagement and help clarify difficult concepts. To expand flexibility, the companion tool PDB2AR allows users to generate custom AR/VR scenes from Protein Data Bank entries, AlphaFold models, or objects exported from visualization software. These can be explored in stand-alone AR/VR or within MolecularWebXR, a multiuser immersive platform. MolecularWebXR provides shared virtual rooms where participants, represented as avatars, can examine curated content on chemistry, materials, and biology, or import their own structures. This framework has been deployed in classrooms, outreach events, and scientific meetings, highlighting its value as a medium for collaborative discussion. The most recent development, HandMol, moves beyond static visualization. Its prototypes enable multiuser, bare-handed manipulation of molecular structures with real-time feedback from molecular mechanics engines. Features include on-the-fly minimization, collaborative docking, seamless file exchange, and natural language control through language models. Soon to be integrated into MolecularWebXR, HandMol transforms immersive visualization into an interactive modeling environment suitable for both education and research. Together, these tools illustrate the progression from 2D visualization to dynamic, collaborative XR systems. By harnessing web technologies and integrating physics-based modeling with AI, the MolecularWeb ecosystem makes immersive molecular science broadly accessible, offering a glimpse of a future where teaching, learning, and discovery are more intuitive and interactive.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Education; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

We construct a cleaned, machine-readable dataset of 256 entries that links polymer size, polymer-solvent compatibility, formulation, and sample history to the radius of gyration, Rg. We evaluate molecular representations and common ML algorithms under both independent-and-identically-distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes, including leave-one-polymer-out and polymer-solvent interaction splits. Under IID, models that combine size, chemistry, formulation, and history achieve strong accuracy (RMSE ≈ 0.18; R² ≈ 0.90), while structure-only models add little beyond polymer size. Generalization is the central limit: OOD errors rise sharply for polar sidechain polymers and formulations with significant Hansen descriptor mismatches, and global distribution shift alone does not explain failure—alignment within key feature subspaces matters. Model uncertainty is reasonably calibrated overall, but degrades under strong distribution shift, limiting reliable experiment selection without targeted data. We identify concrete actions to improve robustness for future machine learning: standardized, machine-readable reporting of processing history (times, temperatures, stimuli); and more deliberate sampling of chemical space. Together, these results highlight dataset design, robust generalization, and uncertainty-aware modeling as the foundations for accelerating discovery and control of conjugated polymer assemblies, capabilities that directly enable autonomous, data-driven experimentation in this field.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Conducting polymers; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e0049abc2ac3a0e0424763/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Minimum energy path calculations suggest that the pseudo-dominant pathway of MeCOTh is towards a non-productive fluorescence decay pathway. Our machine learning photodynamics calculations revealed that relative stereochemical inversion occurs mainly on the S1 surface (74% of trajectories), and we identified two competing inversion pathways. The first and main mechanistic pathway, seen in 62% of trajectories, showcases a “crown” structure with unidirectional sulfurs resulting from S-S closed-shell repulsions. The second pathway is the previously proposed inversion mechanism, which passes through a planar geometry of MeCOTh, and appeared in only 8% of trajectories. Our photodynamic simulations indicate that while excited-state Baird aromaticity contributes to the relative stereochemical inversion mechanism of MeCOTh, it is not the primary electronic effect. Instead, closed-shell repulsions generally drive the inversion mechanism.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Photochemistry (Org.); Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Machine learning photodynamics reveal competing inversion paths of methylated cyclooctatetrathiophene", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68dfe704dfd0d042d1d807fb/original/machine-learning-photodynamics-reveal-competing-inversion-paths-of-methylated-cyclooctatetrathiophene.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The diversity of MOF building blocks makes exhaustive experimental or simulation-based screening for high mechanical stability impractical. While some prior work has used machine learning (ML) to accelerate discovery, ML models typically lack the ability to generalize across diverse MOF topologies. Starting from a dataset with around an order of magnitude more secondary building units and topology types than previously studied, we develop a generalizable and interpretable ML framework to predict MOF mechanical stability (i.e., the bulk modulus). Our ML models incorporate novel and interpretable topological features developed based on principles of net theory and chemical features that are applicable across a broad range of MOF chemistries and topologies. We employ our models in a virtual high-throughput screening of over ~435k MOFs from existing hypothetical and experimental databases to identify the most mechanically stable candidates with potential industrial applications.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68def9b6dfd0d042d1bce2de/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Two model variants are introduced: one that evolves the full complex-valued wavefunction and the other that propagates only the electron density. Both models are trained on trajectory data generated from tight-binding Hamiltonians and a time-dependent electron-phonon coupled system. Our results demonstrate that wavefunction-based models achieve near-exact long-time propagation across static and dynamic regimes, while density-only models maintain strong performance using physics-informed loss functions, even in the absence of phase information.

We study the nature of the optical excitation for these particles and how the optical and electronic properties of these particles change with the size of their inorganic core. We demonstrate that for all families of particle studied, except those where the corners are capped with aromatic ligands, the optical gap, the onset of light absorption, blueshifts with deceasing particle-core size. For the particles where the corners are capped with alkyl phosphines, phosphine oxides or amines the optical gap is predicted to correspond to an excitation where both the hole and excited electron are delocalised over the inorganic core of the particle, a core-to-core excitation, and hence resemble the cartoon picture of a quantum dot. In contrast, we predict that for particles exclusively capped with bisulfide or alkylthiolate ligands, the optical gap corresponds to a charge-transfer excitation with the hole localised on a subset of ligands and only the excited-electron delocalised over the inorganic core of the particle. For particles where the corners are capped with aromatic ligands the optical gap is predicted to correspond to a ligand-to-ligand excitation, which because of its localised nature does not significantly shift with particle size. However, for these particles with aromatic ligands, core-to-core excitation, lie only slightly higher in energy, and these excited states will shift with particle size and will likely become the optical gap for large(r) particles. Moreover, as core-to-core excitations are predicted to be much more intense than ligand-to-ligand excitations, experimentally one is likely to observe a blueshift with particle size even for particle sizes where the optical gap technically is a ligand-to-ligand excitation. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Nanoscience; Nanostructured Materials - Nanoscience; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Spectroscopy (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary discussion, figures and tables", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68dda5743e708a764924ff02/original/supplementary-discussion-figures-and-tables.pdf"}, {"title": "DFT optimised structures of all relevant particles", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68dda5743e708a764924ff07/original/dft-optimised-structures-of-all-relevant-particles.zip"}]</p></details> |

This study focuses on four different borophene phases: alpha, beta12, gamma3, and trigonal, and systematically investigates their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. By using density functional theory (DFT), we evaluate the intrinsic catalytic activity of pristine borophene monolayers as well as the influence of an Ag(111) substrate on their HER behavior. The results indicate that the pristine alpha, beta12, and gamma3 phases exhibit excellent HER activity, characterized by optimal Gibbs free energies for hydrogen adsorption. Especially, the on-top site with the lowest coordination number is identified as the most active site. However, interaction with the Ag(111) support significantly modifies the hydrogen binding, leading to suppressed HER performance in these phases. In contrast, the trigonal phase displays relatively poor HER performance, attributed to its fully saturated bonding environment, while the silver substrate significantly modifies its geometric configuration and slightly enhances the HER performance. This work highlights both the promising intrinsic HER potential of borophene monolayers and the critical impact of substrate interactions, guiding the design of efficient borophene-based electrocatalysts.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Electrocatalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Achieving autonomous operation of such systems, as observed in nature, presents an even greater difficulty. 
Here, we report PdII-mediated coordination capsules based on ligand 1 embedding an azobispyrazole photoswitch. The more thermodynamically stable E-photoisomer forms an equilibrium mixture of a PdII3(E-1)6 double-walled triangle and a PdII2(E-1)4 lantern in a 78:22 ratio. UV-light irradiation transforms both structures into a PdII2(Z-1)4 lantern, which then reverts solely to the out-of-equilibrium PdII2(E-1)4 lantern when exposed to visible light. The complete photoisomerisation proceeds through an information ratchet mechanism that can operate autonomously under continuous white light or sunlight exposure, selectively accumulating the out-of-equilibrium PdII2(E-1)4 structure.

The basis sets employed are based on the Dunning series: cc-pVXZ, with X ranging from double-ζ to quintuple-ζ and include the bases augmented with diffuse functions: aug-cc-pVXZ. The calculations are possible thanks to an extension of the coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham code in the GAUSSIAN software to work with a different number of orbitals at each k point in reciprocal space, as orbitals with small overlap eigenvalues are projected out during the orthonormalization procedure of the basis set before the self-consistent field procedure used to evaluate the energy.

Acid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs), part of the sodium-selective ENaC/DEG family, are implicated in processes such as pain, fear, memory, and cancer. Like other sodium channels, ASICs permit partially hydrated cations to permeate their pore, with solvent deuteration influencing conductance and ion permeability. Here, we investigate ion selectivity in ASIC1 and the associated kinetic isotope effects that arise from ion solvation. We combined molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and open quantum systems simulations to study sodium, potassium, and lithium in H\textsubscript{2}O and D\textsubscript{2}O. Analyses focused on the conserved selectivity filter, comprising the GAS belt and HG motif of the re-entrant loop. Results reveal that binding energies, dehydration costs, and conformational changes jointly shape selectivity. Ion escape rates correlate with ionic mass and solvent shell radius, partially explaining experimental observations. Crucially, coherence lifetimes fall within the sub-femtosecond regime, ruling out quantum coherence and tunnelling as drivers of high selectivity. These findings clarify the biophysical principles of ASIC1 function and provide insights for therapeutic strategies targeting ASIC-related disorders, including chronic pain and cancer.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Biology; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information File", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68dc1cc1f2aff16770427089/original/supplementary-information-file.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Most of these studies either considered only a limited number of DFT approaches or included relatively few structures in the validation against experimental data. Using the Gaussian and plane wave DFT code CP2K, this work aims at a more comprehensive assessment, comparing 27 semilocal approaches that include dispersion interactions either by means of a pairwise correction ("Grimme-type" D3) or in the framework of a nonlocal density functional. The set of silica polymorphs encompasses three minerals and 16 all-silica zeolites. For those approaches that perform well with a moderately sized (triple-zeta) basis set, the effect of adding additional basis functions is evaluated. This (slightly) improves the performance in the majority of cases, especially for relative energies. All in all, those functionals that deliver best agreement with experiment achieve overall errors (as expressed by the mean unsigned error) on the order of 0.2 T atoms per 1000 Å³ for framework densities and of 1.0 kJ mol⁻¹ (per SiO₂ formula unit) for relative energies. Due to the favourable scaling behaviour of CP2K, structure optimisations of complex zeolites structures are routinely feasible. This is demonstrated through additional calculations for three recently reported all-silica zeolites with extra-large pores.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Materials Chemistry; Crystallography | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information PDF", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e37b03bc2ac3a0e094cd60/original/supporting-information-pdf.pdf"}, {"title": "Supporting Information EXCEL", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e37b54dfd0d042d127a09a/original/supporting-information-excel.xlsx"}, {"title": "Archive of DFT-optimised structures", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e37b70dfd0d042d127a25b/original/archive-of-dft-optimised-structures.zip"}]</p></details> |

The concerted type (CPET) offers unique kinetic advantages but remains challenging to model quantitatively within theoretical and computational frameworks, owing to the interplay of multiple quantum mechanical (QM) factors such as proton–electron nonadiabatic dynamics, anharmonic proton transfer (PT) potentials, and multimode vibronic coupling.  When applied to CPET, standard simulation frameworks such as the Multistate Continuum (MSC) and Marcus-Levich-Jortner (MLJ) theories typically treat all solute vibrations other than the transferring-proton mode classically and neglect Duschinsky (mode-mixing) effects. Herein, we present the vibration correlation function with effective anharmonicity (VCF-H) method, which extends the VCF formalism to systematically incorporate multidimensional vibronic coupling and Duschinsky transformations together with effective anharmonic corrections.  Applications to CPET model systems---the phenoxyl/phenol and thymine-acrylamide complexes---reveal that Duschinsky coupling between the transferring-proton motion and the donor-acceptor stretching mode, ignored in MSC/MLJ treatments, can enhance the predicted rate constants by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, comparison across hierarchical approximations to VCF-H demonstrates that classical treatments of non-PT vibrational modes can substantially underestimate rate-constant predictions, whereas the fully QM description retained in VCF-H exerts a substantial influence on them. These results establish VCF-H method as a streamlined and physically transparent framework for modeling CPET reactions, clarify its theoretical relationship to MSC/MLJ formulations, and highlight the critical role of multidimensional vibronic and Duschinsky effects in modeling CPET dynamics.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Physical and Chemical Processes | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Detailed theoretical and computational information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e13fddbc2ac3a0e06019dd/original/detailed-theoretical-and-computational-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

By recognizing the orbital coefficient matrix and the fractional occupation vectors as two independent variables, this work provides a new viewpoint upon GC-SCF as an optimization problem on a product manifold of a flag manifold and a Euclidean space. During the optimization process, the manifold is automatically adjusted to the orbitals, which are divided into three partitions based on the occupation numbers, so that the occupation numbers are optimized properly, avoiding notorious gradient explosion and vanishing. Important concepts in manifold optimization and their specific expressions in GC-SCF are given. Via numerical benchmarks on three molecules at the room temperature and certain electrochemical potentials, our method is shown to be more efficient than the conventional direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS).</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary materials", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e2270dbc2ac3a0e075a00f/original/supplementary-materials.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This protein exists in dimeric form, with each monomer containing a retinal Schiff base (RSB) moiety covalently bonded that undergoes trans-cis isomerization upon light absorption. However, the limited penetration depth of visible light in biological tissues motivates the use of multiphoton-absorption techniques, which enhance tissue penetration, improve focality, and reduce phototoxicity, thereby offering a promising alternative for optogenetic applications. In this paper, we present a fully atomistic multiscale methodology for computing the one-, two-, and three-photon absorption spectra of ChR2, where the protein, lipid bilayer, and solvent are explicitly considered throughout the workflow. This methodology integrates classical MD, QM/MM MD, and fragment-based polarizable embedding (PE) to derive environment-specific PE potentials from the explicit protein–lipid–solvent environment. The final step in the methodology is to use these potentials to compute accurate spectra via PE-TD-DFT. Validation against experimental one-photon absorption spectra demonstrates excellent agreement. For the first time, we report the theoretical two- and three-photon absorption in ChR2, albeit without direct experimental comparison. We compare the MPA spectra where the two RSB moieties are sampled using classical MD and QM/MM MD, respectively. The resulting spectral differences are attributed to variations in key structural parameters that we analyze and document.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Multiphoton Absorption Spectra of Channelrhodopsin-2 via Multiscale Simulation Methods", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68e01c93bc2ac3a0e04562d2/original/multiphoton-absorption-spectra-of-channelrhodopsin-2-via-multiscale-simulation-methods.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Building on a gradient-enhanced Kriging surrogate model and restricted-variance optimization, we introduce three key modifications: (i) a cost-effective subspace expansion using r-GDIIS or BFGS displacement predictions, (ii) a systematic undershoot mitigation strategy in flat energy regions, and (iii) rigorous coordinate and gradient transformations consistent with the exponential parametrization of orbital rotations. Benchmarking across an extensive set of molecular systems – including organic molecules, radicals, and transition-metal complexes – demonstrates that the new S-GEK/RVO variants consistently outperform the default (in OpenMolcas) r-GDIIS method in iteration count, convergence reliability, and wall time. These improvements make S-GEK/RVO a competitive alternative for SCF optimization and suggest broader applicability to other orbital optimization and localization problems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |
