We present SPACESHIP, an AI-driven framework for dynamic, constraint-free exploration of synthesizable regions in chemical parameter spaces. SPACESHIP integrates probabilistic models and uncertainty-aware acquisition to learn from both successful and failed experiments to adaptively refine feasible synthesis conditions. A central feature is the Autopilot strategy, which dynamically selects between models and achieves up to 4.3× faster exploration than does random sampling. When applied to gold (Au) nanoparticle (NP) and nanorod (NR) synthesis, SPACESHIP identified synthesizable regions with 90% accuracy in only 23 experiments and reached 97% accuracy within 127 experiments—substantially fewer than the 625 experiments required to establish the ground truth. This method also enables the ternary classification of Au NRs on the basis of their optical properties, revealing distinct growth regimes. Compared with literature-based maps, SPACESHIP expanded the validated synthesizable space by a factor of 8 for NPs and 4 for NRs, supporting scalable discovery and mechanistic insight.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Robotics; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information for SPACESHIP: synthesizable parameter acquisition via closed-loop exploration and self-directed, hardware-aware intelligent protocols for autonomous lab", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68357b99c1cb1ecda0b98506/original/supplementary-information-for-spaceship-synthesizable-parameter-acquisition-via-closed-loop-exploration-and-self-directed-hardware-aware-intelligent-protocols-for-autonomous-lab.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This study documents the optimization of reward functions for a reinforecement learning (RL)-based generator targeting non-covalent inhibitors of KRAS. In particular, we study the relative effect of additive versus multiplicative reward components in a multiobjective function using docking environments and pharmaocphore modeling. Our findings illustrate how to maximize the outcome of a target criterion, using the number of molecules that meet or surpass a target docking score. In the process, we find an apparent compounding effect of docking and pharmacophore modeling on the generators’ results. From these results, we identify and assess a promising non-covalent inhibitor candidate molecule based on docking score and likely interactions across a variety of KRAS mutants.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Figure S1", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6835228cc1cb1ecda0a43678/original/figure-s1.pdf"}, {"title": "Generated molecules for RI-NO-MULT", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/683522b0c1cb1ecda0a43fd7/original/generated-molecules-for-ri-no-mult.csv"}, {"title": "Generated molecules for RI-MULT-ADD", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6835230f1a8f9bdab51f4ac1/original/generated-molecules-for-ri-mult-add.csv"}, {"title": "Generated molecules for RI-MULT-NO", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6835233fc1cb1ecda0a456e5/original/generated-molecules-for-ri-mult-no.csv"}, {"title": "Generated molecules for RI-MULT-MULT-1", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/683523993ba0887c33240a06/original/generated-molecules-for-ri-mult-mult-1.csv"}, {"title": "Generated molecules for RI-MULT-MULT-2", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/683523c21a8f9bdab51f6b47/original/generated-molecules-for-ri-mult-mult-2.csv"}, {"title": "Generated molecules for RI-MULT-MULT-3", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/683523dbc1cb1ecda0a4785b/original/generated-molecules-for-ri-mult-mult-3.csv"}, {"title": "Generated molecules for RI-NO-NO", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/683528643ba0887c33252d22/original/generated-molecules-for-ri-no-no.csv"}]</p></details> |

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) models, particularly graph neural networks, have shown great promise in capturing complex chemical interactions. Here, directed message-passing neural networks (D-MPNNs) on graph overlays of the reactant and product graphs were shown to provide promising accuracies for reaction property prediction. They only rely on the change in molecular graphs as input and thus require no additional information during inference. However, the reaction barrier height intrinsically depends on the conformations of the reactants, transition state, and products, which are not taken into account in standard D-MPNNs. In this work, we present a hybrid approach where we combine the power of D-MPNNs predicting barrier heights with generative models predicting transition state geometries on-the-fly, only given the reaction graph. The resulting model thus only requires two-dimensional graph information as input, while internally leveraging three-dimensional information to increase accuracy. We furthermore evaluate the influence of additional physical features on D-MPNN models of reaction barrier heights, where we find that additional features only marginally enhance predictive accuracy and are especially helpful for small datasets. In contrast, our hybrid graph/coordinate approach reduces the error of barrier height predictions for all investigated datasets.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6834bf531a8f9bdab5051b3a/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Chemical practitioners are not immune to the appeal of foundation models, nor are they immune to the many risks and harms that these models introduce. In this work, I present the first analysis of foundation models using the combined lens of scientific ethics and chemical professional ethics. I find that general-purpose generative foundation models are in many ways incompatible with the moral practice of chemistry, though there are fewer ethical problems with chemistry-specific foundation models. My discussion concludes with an examination of how the harm associated with foundation models can be minimized and further poses a set of serious lingering questions for chemical practitioners and scientific ethicists.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Chemical Education; Chemical Education - General; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/683209ebc1cb1ecda02e0ddd/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

This model considers 12 molecular and atomic parameters to compute the composition and melting point of binary fluoride/chloride reciprocal eutectic salt systems. The Principal Component Analysis-Feed Forward Neural Network methodology demonstrated enhanced prediction accuracy, with a mean root mean squared error of 5.533 for melting point and 1.329 for eutectic composition, as assessed by the leave-one-out cross-validation method (LOOCV). Further, the R2 values of the melting point and eutectic composition, for the models with the least RMSE on test data, were 97.69 % and 97.26 % respectively. This modelling technique offers the potential to forecast the composition and melting points of multi-component reciprocal eutectic salt systems, and also to ascertain the other properties of reciprocal eutectic salt systems, such as their densities, enthalpies, conductivities, and so on.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Energy Storage; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Despite its prevalence, the process remains challenging due to the lack of a general theory and well-understood underlying reaction mechanisms. While prior works have successfully extracted structured datasets from literature, they often neglect product phase purity or yield. In this work, we construct a solid-state synthesis dataset consisting of 80,823 syntheses extracted with a large language model (LLM), including 18,874 reactions with impurity phase(s). Our dataset not only validates expected thermodynamic trends for impurity phase formation but also identifies challenging cases where impurity phases emerge even when the target phase is significantly more stable.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

We utilize ab initio information from the quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM) for 60k transition metal complexes at multiple levels of theory (LOT), presented here in the tmQM+ dataset, to inform flexible graph neural network (GNN) models. We evaluate these models with several experiments, including training on limited charge and elemental compositions 1 and testing on unseen charges and elements, as well as training on smaller portions of the dataset. Results show that additional quantum chemical information improves performance on unseen regimes and smaller training sets. Furthermore, we leverage the tmQM+ dataset to analyze how QTAIM descriptors vary across different LOT and probe machine learning performance with less computationally expensive LOT. We determine that ab initio descriptors provide benefits across LOT, thereby motivating the use of lower-level DFT descriptors, particularly for predicting expensive or experimental molecular properties.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Elucidating structure-activity-relationships for odorants and their receptors remains difficult since crystallization of the odour receptors extremely difficult. Therefore, ligand-based approaches that leverage machine learning remain the state of the art for predicting odorant properties for molecules, such as the graph neural network approach used by. In this paper we explore how information from Quantum Mechanics (QM) could synergistically improve the results obtained with the graph neural network.

Although machine learning models have successfully predicted chemical structures from individual spectroscopic modalities, they typically fail to integrate multiple modalities concurrently, as expert chemists usually do. Here, we introduce a multimodal multitask transformer model capable of accurately predicting molecular structures from integrated spectroscopic data, including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Trained initially on extensive simulated datasets and subsequently finetuned on experimental spectra, our model achieves Top-1 prediction accuracies up to 96%. We demonstrate the model's capability to leverage synergistic information from different spectroscopic techniques and show that it performs on par with expert human chemists, significantly outperforming traditional computational methods. Our model represents a major advancement toward fully automated chemical analysis, offering substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy for chemical research and discovery.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Anal.

A central challenge is integrating AL with flexible, physics-aware potentials to achieve quantum-level accuracy for complex interfacial systems. Our approach trains physics-aware potentials, with incorporated flexibility and smoothness, on actively sampled Density Functional Theory (DFT) data to describe interactions between undercoordinated atomic silver (Ag) clusters and gaseous pollutants (CO$_2$, CO, SO$_2$), relevant for environmental applications like sensing. The AL process follows three stages: (1) FFs are trained using adaptable physics aware potentials of semi-empirical descriptors, optimized via a Pareto analysis scheme; (2) refined FFs generate candidate structures through Metropolis Hastings Monte Carlo (MHMC) or stochastic molecular dynamics (sMD); (3) a subset of candidates is selected for DFT labeling based on an outlier score (OS), which utilizes the existing data descriptor distributions, ensuring diverse PES exploration. This framework produces FFs capable of capturing cohesive, physisorption, and chemisorption interactions with accuracy comparable to \textit{ab initio} methods and advanced machine learning models, while retaining the efficiency of semi-empirical potentials. Our methodology is highly versatile, easily accommodating various choices of descriptors, model basis sets, and sampling techniques. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Clusters | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Manuscript supporting figures, tables and discussion", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6834285bc1cb1ecda0785734/original/manuscript-supporting-figures-tables-and-discussion.pdf"}, {"title": "Generated data through the Active Learning scheme", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6834291e3ba0887c33f92dee/original/generated-data-through-the-active-learning-scheme.zip"}]</p></details> |

There is therefore a strong incentive to machine learn NACs for accelerating simulations. However, this is challenging due to NACs’ vectorial, double-valued character and the singularity near a conical intersection seam. For the first time, we design NAC-specific descriptors based on our domain expertise and show that they allow learning NACs with never-before-reported accuracy of R2 exceeding 0.99. The key to success is also our new ML phase-correction procedure. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach on a prototypical example of fully ML-driven FSSH simulations of fulvene targeting the SA-2-CASSCF(6,6) electronic structure level. This ML-FSSH dynamics leads to an accurate description of S1 decay while reducing error bars by allowing the execution of a large ensemble of trajectories. Our implementations are available in open-source MLatom.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

A high fraction of such chemicals poses a wide array of health risks for humans by affecting various adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). Carcinogenicity has been one of the most alarming adverse effects exhibited by these chemicals, which affects millions worldwide.  For the efficient identification and safe disposal of such agricultural and industrial chemicals, it becomes necessary to quickly and easily determine toxicity and fill toxicity data gaps.  In this study, we have developed multiple Machine Learning (ML) regression-based models that quantitatively predict the Oral Slope Factor (OSF) and Inhalation Slope Factor (ISF) of chemicals, identifying and prioritizing carcinogenicity risks. At first, we have developed Partial Least Squares (PLS) Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models. Aiming to further enhance the robustness and external predictivity of the models and better utilize the available chemical space, we have developed similarity-driven quantitative Read-Across Structure-Activity Relationship (q-RASAR) models. Further, we explored the Arithmetic Residuals in K-Groups Analysis (ARKA) to develop the Hybrid ARKA and ARKA-RASAR models in the quest for considering the response range-specific contribution of descriptors. We have used simple and reproducible Partial Least Squares (PLS) modeling algorithm to develop QSAR, q-RASAR, Hybrid ARKA and ARKA-RASAR models for both the responses, and further applied a wide array of ML modeling algorithms like Linear Support Vector Regression (LSVR), Ridge Regression (RR), k-Nearest Neighbor Regression (k-NN), Multilayer Perceptron Regression (MLP), Random Forests Regression (RF), Extra Trees Regression (ET), Gradient Boosting Regression (GB), PLS, and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) as stacking regressors. The best performing models were selected using the multi-criteria decision-making approach – the Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD), considering training, test, and cross-validation statistics. Additionally, we have predicted the OSF and ISF of a true external data set and showed that the quantitative results align well with the reported carcinogenic status. With enhanced robustness and external predictivity of the models, the ARKA-RASAR approach has been shown to be a useful tool in ecotoxicological risk assessments.  </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Materials SI-1, SI-2, SI-3", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/683156573ba0887c339697a0/original/supplementary-materials-si-1-si-2-si-3.zip"}]</p></details> |

Our goal is the transferable prediction of retention times: Our method should predict retention times for a target dataset, without the need of training data from that chromatographic system. Unfortunately, retention times may change massively, even for nominally identical chromatographic conditions. Retention order is much better retained, yet even the retention order of compounds may change if chromatographic conditions vary. We present a machine learning model that can predict retention order or, more precisely, a retention order index, taking into account chromatographic conditions. We show how to map predicted retention order indices to retention times. Disentangling these two task finally enables transferable retention time prediction across chromatographic conditions and compound classes. Our 2-step method outperforms existing methods that were trained on the target dataset.

As even state-of-the-art characterization techniques lack the resolution and efficiency for the unambiguous elucidation of decomposition kinetics and reconstruction dynamics at electrocatalytic interfaces, many atomistic modeling approaches—following the recent advances in physics-driven machine learning—have been widely used to facilitate the atom-by-atom understanding and rational engineering of electrocatalyst stability and dynamics. This Perspective systematically assesses classical and data-driven approaches in theoretical surface science and computational catalysis, recognizing their achievements and highlighting their limitations in throughput, efficiency, accuracy, bias, transferability, and scalability toward enabling realistic and predictive modeling of electrocatalyst degradation and reconstruction. By examining different methods spanning first-principles simulations, surface sampling, neural network interatomic potentials, and generative deep learning models, it is underscored how such data-driven computational techniques help elucidate the precise nature of various key interfacial atomistic processes to address existing technical challenges in surface modeling and provide a new paradigm to optimize dissolution kinetics and restructuring dynamics for electrocatalyst design.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Electrocatalysis; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

The analyzed dataset included chemicals that were screened in a competitive binding assay designed to measure the reduction in fluorescence due to displacement of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid ammonium salt (ANSA) from TTR. The data were randomly split into a training set of 1012 compounds, a leaderboard set of 200, and a blind set of 300. This article provides an overview of the Tox24 Challenge and some of the models developed by the participating teams. Some of the approaches taken by winning teams included use of mixtures, enumerating tautomers, data cleaning. Many of the teams used consensus models. Overall, there has been significant progress in the development of machine learning tools since the Tox21 Challenge. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

Here, motivated by the proven ability of Machine-Learning (ML) algorithms to perform classification tasks, we harness ML-based tools and existing chemical datasets to ask the following question: can the existence of polymorphs of a molecular crystal be predicted based solely on properties of the single molecule. We find that our algorithm can predict the existence of polymorphism with an average accuracy of 65% at best, not enough to generate a reliable “polymorph predicting” engine. Moreover, our results imply that the number of polymorphs is much larger than that reported in the literature. We suggest two possible reasons for the poor performance, both providing important insights. The first is that the data is inherently biased towards mono-morphs, as many polymorphs are reported as mono-morphs, not because they indeed have only one stable crystal structure, but rather because only on crystal form has been observed in experiments. The second reason is even more profound, suggesting that the many-body nature of crystallization limits the possibility of predicting crystal properties based solely on single-molecule characteristics.  </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Machine Learning; Quantum Mechanics; Crystallography – Organic | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/682ed82b3ba0887c33352ef2/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Despite the good biocompatibility of CB8, its practical use is limited by the poor solubility, which could be resolved by methyl substitution Me4CB8. However, this comes with additional difficulties in molecular modelling due to the breaking of the D8h symmetry (to C2v and even lower). The binding-mode space is further complicated by complex structural features of abused drugs (e.g., Fentanyl with multiple aromatic rings). In this work, we present a thorough characterization of cucurbiturils host-guest coordinations on a batch of practical detoxification situations with advanced enhanced sampling techniques in conjunction with the most accurate fixed-charge parameter set, where the water-soluble methylated Me4CB8 is parametrized at B97-3c and the 10 abused drugs are fitted at r2SCAN-3c, achieving a practical accuracy limit of current fixed-charge modelling for cucurbiturils host-guest binding. While the predicted binding thermodynamics agree with experimental values, additional all-atom insights into the binding modes and the nature of host-guest interactions that are absent in experimental measurements are presented in great detail, using a combination of force-field energetics and advanced quantum mechanics-based energy decomposition analysis.  </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Computational Chemistry and Modeling | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "SI", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6835ac6fc1cb1ecda0c225d6/original/si.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Coherences encode critical information about the phase and dynamics of a system, and their interaction with its environment. Particularly, the ultrafast charge transfer process between electron donor and acceptor species in functional energy materials is influenced by vibronic coherences. A key limitation arises from the dephasing of coherences due to dissipation, causing loss of information and limiting applications of molecular systems. Extending and controlling coherence lifetimes would enable the rational design of smarter materials with optimised properties. Here we introduce a novel idea using chirped excitations as a pathway to extend quantum coherence lifetimes, enhancing their robustness against dissipation. A detailed analysis of the light-induced molecular quantum dynamics and wave packet evolution from first-principles models constructed at the donor–acceptor heterojunction of an organic photovoltaic blend is discussed. We demonstrate that tuning the chirp of the excitation pulse, vibronic coherence lifetimes can be extended up to the picosecond timescale. Chirped excitations also enable tunable spatial localisation of the induced wave packet, with localisation controlled by the chirp intensity. These effects are observed consistently across different donor–acceptor adducts selected from the molecular dynamics structure of the blend. Our results introduce a new degree of freedom for coherent control in molecular systems, offering a promising pathway toward the development of advanced functional energy materials and applications in molecular quantum information science. </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information: Extending Quantum Coherence Lifetimes in Nonadiabatic Dissipative Molecular Systems with Chirped Pulses", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6834263fc1cb1ecda078260b/original/supplementary-information-extending-quantum-coherence-lifetimes-in-nonadiabatic-dissipative-molecular-systems-with-chirped-pulses.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The reaction works well with a wide range of alkyl and aryl azides bearing both electron-donating and -withdrawing groups. This contrasts RuAAC reactions using regular terminal and internal alkynes, where aryl azides bearing electron-withdrawing groups are not generally tolerated. The regioselectivity of the cycloaddition is highly dependent on the identity of the non-selenium substituent of the alkyne. This challenges earlier reports on RuAAC reactions involving thioalkynes and questions the perceived understanding of the regioselectivity of these reactions. Computational modelling of the reaction profiles for four alkyne substrates that provided contrasting regioselectivities accurately reproduces the experimental results. The observed regioselectivity is primarily attributed to the relative nucleophilicity of the alkyne carbons upon coordination to ruthenium and an approach is proposed in which reaction regioselectivity may be predicted.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Theory - Computational; Homogeneous Catalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68370943c1cb1ecda0f473bb/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The ability to distinguish between specific PET channels and compare their timescales with competing photophysical events is also essential for the design synthetic light harvesting systems. However, commonly used statistical rate theories break down owing to strong electronic coupling and the nonequilibrium nature of PET. The assignment of specific time-resolved spectroscopic signatures to particular photophysical processes also remains a notorious challenge. Here, we employed nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics simulations to characterize ultrafast PET in a model system of two stacked adenine nucleobases. We next performed rate calculations for two of the identified PET channels with three different statistical rate theories. In particular, the widely used classical Marcus Theory and Fermi's Golden Rule cannot describe ultrafast PET and offer even qualitative rate trends. We demonstrate that these challenges can be overcome with microcanonical Rice-Rampsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory, which yields PET timescales that are in excellent agreement with excited-state dynamics simulations. We conclude that while (non-)adiabatic RRKM theory cannot grasp the dynamical nature of PET, it offers strong predictive capacity for the design of efficient photoredox-active chromophores.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theory - Computational; Chemical Kinetics; Photochemistry (Physical Chem.) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Electronic Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6834a5ecc1cb1ecda0867ef3/original/electronic-supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |
