However, a key limitation arises with molecules exhibiting resonance, where multiple valid Lewis structures represent the same species. This causes inconsistent predictions for the same molecule based on the chosen resonance form in common property prediction frameworks like Chemprop, which implements a directed message-passing neural network (D-MPNN) architecture on the input molecular graph. To address this issue of resonance variance, we introduce the Resonance Invariant Graph Representation (RIGR) of molecules that ensures, by construction, that all resonance structures are mapped to a single representation, eliminating the need to choose from or generate multiple resonance structures. Implemented with the D-MPNN architecture, RIGR is evaluated on a large dataset with resonance-exhibiting radicals and closed-shell molecules, comparing it against the Chemprop featurizer. Using 60% fewer features, RIGR demonstrates comparable or superior prediction performance. Alternative approaches, such as data augmentation with resonance forms, are assessed, and their limitations are explored. Available open-source as an optional featurization scheme in Chemprop, RIGR is benchmarked across a wide range of property prediction tasks, showcasing its potential as a general graph featurizer beyond resonance handling.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information: RIGR: Resonance Invariant Graph Representation for Molecular Property Prediction", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d35179f4163037700edd44/original/supporting-information-rigr-resonance-invariant-graph-representation-for-molecular-property-prediction.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Molecular dynamics (MD) driven by a custom-trained neural network (NN) potential were scaled to simulate 5,120 atoms for 100 nanoseconds in order to identify and characterize a unique structural prototype for glassy sulfide solid electrolytes with the stoichiometry LiGa(SeS3)2, featuring GaS4 tetrahedra interconnected by bridging Se-S covalent chains. A phase transition from a crystalline phase to a structurally-disordered phase of LiGa(SeS3)2 was identified in the simulations between 325 and 350 K, whereby the molar volume and ionic conductivity significantly increase, while the vibrational density of states spectra for Li+ becomes characteristically broadened, similar to superionic conductors. The ionic conductivity is calculated to be around 10^-2 S/cm at 350 K. Furthermore, this glassy sulfide solid electrolyte exhibits an anomalously low bulk modulus of 0.7 GPa, which may be beneficial for accommodating plasticity in the solid electrolyte of an all solid-state inorganic battery. The electrochemical stability window is predicted to be relatively narrow since the band gap is conservatively 1.45 eV, but the stability window could potentially be tuned by doping to form an oxysulfide.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Ceramics; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

However, design optimizations have largely focused on structural properties, leaving the impact of the electronic environment less explored. To investigate how the electronic environment influences reactivity, we carry out both classical and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a series of mimochromes, MC6, MC6*, and MC6*a, with known differences in reactivity. To uncover patterns in electronic structure, we train supervised machine learning (ML) models and carry out statistical analysis. The ab initio MD simulations uncover key charge coupling interactions between Arg10' and Glu2' that are not identified in classical dynamics. These residues are determined to be essential in orienting Arg10' in the active site. Furthermore, using our ML classifiers trained to distinguish mimochromes based on partial charge dynamics alone, we identify critical residues such as Arg10', Lys11, Glu2', and Ser6' that distinguish the mimochrome analogues. Disruption of the computationally-identified Glu2'···Lys11 salt bridge in a new mimochrome analogue, MC6*a-LysBoc, that we synthesize and characterize experimentally supports this prediction by resulting in a seven-fold decrease in the total turnover number. Quantum mechanical calculations show that Arg10' stabilizes the transition state for the formation of the reactive oxo from hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that partial charge distribution dynamics are important in the reactivity series in mimochromes, which should guide the engineering of a broad array of next-generation metalloenzymes.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Catalysis; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning; Biocatalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplemental tables and figures", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d30cbff2aff16770398919/original/supplemental-tables-and-figures.pdf"}]</p></details> |

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) based on collision-activated dissociation (CAD) is a standard approach used to identify unknown compounds in complex mixtures. However, CAD often produces similar fragmentation patterns for isomeric or related ionized analytes, which makes it difficult to identify specific functional groups. MS/MS methods based on diagnostic gas-phase ion-molecule reactions provides a powerful, predictable, and reliable alternative for the identification of specific functional groups in unknown ions and differentiation of isomeric ions. However, the interpretation of the experimental results, the selection of the appropriate neutral reagents for new analytes, and the optimization of the conditions for their introduction is a manual, time-consuming and challenging process. We have developed a chemical graph-based interpretable machine learning approach that enables automated identification of functionalities in previously unknown protonated analytes. Furthermore, the approach also facilitates the automatic selection of neutral reagents for previously unstudied analytes and automatic optimization of the pulsing-in and pumping-out times for the neutral reagents introduced into the mass spectrometer. We believe that this work lays the foundation of developing automated HPLC/MS2 platforms with applications to identify unknown compounds in complex mixtures in all areas of chemical science.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Analytical Chemistry; Organic Compounds and Functional Groups; Mass Spectrometry; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d0d9bdf416303770b1cdaf/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

We construct a cleaned, machine-readable dataset of 256 entries that links polymer size, polymer-solvent compatibility, formulation, and sample history to the radius of gyration, Rg. We evaluate molecular representations and common ML algorithms under both independent-and-identically-distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes, including leave-one-polymer-out and polymer-solvent interaction splits. Under IID, models that combine size, chemistry, formulation, and history achieve strong accuracy (RMSE ≈ 0.18; R² ≈ 0.90), while structure-only models add little beyond polymer size. Generalization is the central limit: OOD errors rise sharply for polar sidechain polymers and formulations with significant Hansen descriptor mismatches, and global distribution shift alone does not explain failure—alignment within key feature subspaces matters. Model uncertainty is reasonably calibrated overall, but degrades under strong distribution shift, limiting reliable experiment selection without targeted data. We identify concrete actions to improve robustness for future machine learning: standardized, machine-readable reporting of processing history (times, temperatures, stimuli); and more deliberate sampling of chemical space. Together, these results highlight dataset design, robust generalization, and uncertainty-aware modeling as the foundations for accelerating discovery and control of conjugated polymer assemblies, capabilities that directly enable autonomous, data-driven experimentation in this field.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Polymer Science; Conducting polymers; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d1d3e1f416303770d6501c/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

The success of machine learning-driven projects in chemistry hinges on three key factors: access to robust and comprehensive datasets, a well-defined objective, and effective molecular representations that convert chemical structures into machine-readable formats. Transition metal complexes have lagged behind their organic counterparts on all three of these avenues. The large diversity of structures, coordination numbers and modes have made its translation to a machine-readable format an ongoing challenge. Here we introduce ELECTRUM, an electron configuration-based universal metal fingerprint for transition metal compounds. Its lightweight implementation enables the straightforward conversion of any transition metal complex into a simple fingerprint. Utilising a novel dataset generated from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), we demonstrate that ELECTRUM effectively captures the structural diversity of transition metal complexes. By plotting nearest-neighbor relationships in ELECTRUM space, we reveal meaningful clustering in two-dimensional representations. Furthermore, we use the ELECTRUM encoding to train machine learning models on the prediction of metal complex coordination numbers from ligand structures and metal identity alone. We show that on a subset of this data, we can train models to predict the oxidation state of metal complexes. These case studies showcase the potential of ELECTRUM as an easy-to-implement fingerprint for metal complexes. We rely on the community to further test, validate, and improve it.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Coordination Chemistry (Inorg.); Transition Metal Complexes (Inorg.); Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d16f903e708a7649aac392/original/supporting-information.docx"}]</p></details> |

With the advent of modern machine learning methods DFT-based calculations of energies and forces have been used to train machine learning (ML) models to learn the inter-atomic potential. However, a fatal flaw in DFT-based calculations is the single-particle approximation-based treatment of the exchange-correlation functionals, which severely limits the accuracy of the calculations for materials with open d and f shell elements. ML predictions trained on such limited-accuracy models are also of limited accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate training sophisticated deep learning based ML models on state-of-the-art ab initio dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations of self-energies - the part which is entirely missing in DFT - of real materials. Our calculations show that ML-based methods trained on DMFT self-energies, whereby the ML algorithm is trained to recognise the correlation between non-interacting Green's functions obtained from DFT and self-energies from DMFT, allow the ML models to predict self-energies for Green's functions it has never seen before to a very high accuracy. Taking the example of prototypical SrVO$_3$ a correlated metal, and training on a minimal data set we are able to show that with transfer learning techniques, the ML algorithm is able to predict self energies of CaVO$_3$, BaVO$_3$ and very importantly even for  SrNbO$_3$ - which has a completely different element in the same electronic configuration, and is an extremely important material in terms of futuristic device application as transparent conducting oxide. Our study further shows that the transfer learning technique based on pre-trained models on SrVO$_3$ and SrNbO$_3$ is able to predict the self-energy of BaNbO$_3$ when provided with the non-interacting Green's function, without ever having been trained on its self-energy. Our proof-of-concept demonstrates that ML can predict self-energies of unknown materials using small datasets and transfer learning, drastically reducing computational effort. This approach not only enables efficient predictions but also shows that the physics of diverse systems can be captured with minimal data, paving the way for a transformative shift in materials theory.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68d15940f416303770c49205/original/supplementary-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Here we address this challenge by developing a machine learning model, using high-throughput computational-derived descriptors and a combined experi-mental/literature dataset, to predict regioselectivity (expressed as ΔΔG‡). The resulting Random Forest model achieved high accuracy (cross-validated R² > 0.8, RMSE ~0.4–0.6 kcal/mol) and revealed mechanistically relevant trends through feature importance analysis. For example, the model rationalizes why certain N-donor ligands that fail to promote Cu-catalyzed hydroboration can effectively catalyze alkyne hydrosilylation, linking this divergence to differences in geomet-ric ligand descriptors. Moreover, ML-guided screening identified promising ligands that improved hydroboration out-comes (increased yields and regioselectivity), as confirmed in experiments (e.g., enabling reduced catalyst loading with-out sacrificing selectivity). Overall, this integrated ML strategy offers a powerful tool for understanding and predicting regioselectivity in CuI-mediated reactions and, with appropriate calibration, could be extended to other organocopper systems.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry; Homogeneous Catalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

However, fluoride's high reactivity rapidly degrades traditional organic solvents via nucleophilic attack, limiting practical use. Here, we simultaneously optimize chemical stability and fluoride solvation through an evolutionary computational framework that integrates genetic algorithms, quantum chemistry-based stability screening, and machine-learned solvation models. The framework identifies nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings as optimal structural motifs, with pentafluoropyridine exhibiting exceptional stability and a 2.3-fold enhanced half-life compared to bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether, the current benchmark organic solvent for fluoride salts. These computational insights establish clear design principles—emphasizing heteroatom-induced charge localization and resonance stabilization—that transform electrolyte development from empirical screening toward rational molecular engineering.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Energy Storage | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68ceb98a3e708a76495eb8f6/original/supporting-information.pdf"}]</p></details> |

In our implementation the workflow employed 5 predictive models with each assigning a “yellow card” to 5% of the entries with worst prediction accuracy. The entries with 5 “yellow cards” were considered erroneous. All the base hypotheses from previous studies were tested and verified using computational datasets with controlled number and type of errors added. 
Results confirm the five key hypotheses. Firstly, (i) predictive models generalize effectively and ignore errors during training, and (ii) exhibit weakly correlated prediction errors across architectures, supporting the efficacy of ensemble voting using diverse models. Furthermore, (iii) the group containing maximum number of “yellow cards” is dominated by the erroneous entries, which is indicated by (iv) the U-shaped distribution of entries across groups and the inverted-U pattern in standard deviations of predictions. These visual cues serve as robust, model-agnostic indicators for assessing workflow performance. Finally, (v) the "yellow cards" workflow outperforms simpler methods (absolute error or percentile) in precision-recall metrics.
We provide a step-by-step actionable plan for applying the method to datasets of properties connected to molecular structure, emphasizing model diversity, hyperparameter optimization, threshold selection, and iterative refinement using diagnostic plots. This work establishes a validated, generalizable framework for quality control in chemical data curation, extending to a broad range of structure-dependent molecular properties, and paves the way for more reliable data cleaning in chemistry.

Here, we train a machine learning based interatomic potential (MLIP) to perform large-scale Molecular Dynamics simulations of lithium diffusion in bulk LiF with near-DFT accuracy.
Our study reveals not only conventional vacancy and interstitial transport mechanisms, but also a novel collective ring diffusion process involving six lithium ions. 
This mechanism arises under high interstitial concentrations, and it is stabilized by partial charge delocalization. 
Given the dynamic evolution of the SEI under electrochemical cycling, we suggest that such correlated diffusion events may be transiently active in LiF-rich regions.
More broadly, our results demonstrate the power of MLIPs to access long timescales and complex dynamical behavior, providing a robust framework for future multiscale modeling of the SEI.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Materials Science; Energy; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Energy Storage | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Exploring Lithium Diffusion in LiF with Machine Learning Potentials: From Point Defects to Collective Ring Diffusion  (Supplementary materials)", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68cd8b4723be8e43d6258139/original/exploring-lithium-diffusion-in-li-f-with-machine-learning-potentials-from-point-defects-to-collective-ring-diffusion-supplementary-materials.pdf"}]</p></details> |

Although classical free energy perturbation (FEP) methods provide very accurate lattice free energy estimates, their scalability in large polymorphic landscapes is limited by the need to ergodically sample one chain of overlapping alchemical Boltzmann distributions per polymorph. In contrast, targeted free energy perturbation (TFEP) can converge free energies of the same accuracy directly on the existing physical data sampled in each polymorph. The only major challenge in TFEP is obtaining an accurate bijective mapping between each polymorph and a common reference distribution. To achieve a general mapping strategy, we turn to normalising flow neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of normalising-flow enhanced TFEP in molecular crystals. Specifically, we describe a normalising flow architecture, based on spline-coupling, that can achieve a significant overlap between a Boltzmann distribution of a molecular crystal supercell and the artificial distribution learned by a probabilistic generative model (PGM) trained by example on relatively small amounts of MD data. The accuracy and efficiency of this approach were assessed by comparing PGM-based FE estimates to the reference FE estimates from the Einstein crystal method (ECM). These two methods were applied to three molecules of practical relevance in the pharmaceutical industry: succinic acid, a salt former and starting material, and two drug molecules, Veliparib and Mivebresib. A compelling agreement in accuracy between the PGM and the ECM was observed in the polymorphic landscapes for these three compounds across all supercell sizes that were considered. In addition to showing that normalising flow can provide reliable free energy estimates in systems that are significantly more complex compared to those previously studied at a significantly lower cost than ECM, we also discuss how one can further improve the cost-effectiveness of this approach.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Statistical Mechanics; Materials Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supplementary Materials", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68cfcf623e708a764977d5f7/original/supplementary-materials.pdf"}]</p></details> |

However, adsorbates on catalytic surfaces can be configured in combinatorially many ways and their inter-adsorbate interactions can have an enormous impact on the energetics of reactions. This makes it incredibly challenging to accurately compute coverage dependent kinetic parameters that account for these interactions without expensive enumerative calculations. In this work we present an active learning framework fusing Subgraph Isomorphic Decision Tree (SIDT) based machine learning with automated quantum chemistry calculations to efficiently iteratively learn the coverage dependence of adsorbates and transition states (TS) that we have implemented within our software Pynta. This framework exploits the internal readability of the SIDT using the node uncertainties and occurrence rates in the configurational space to select sets of calculations to run that are expected to best minimize the uncertainties in the SIDT each iteration. We validate our approach against enumerative DFT and cluster expansion approaches for the HO* dissociation reactions on Ru(0001) with O* as the co-adsorbate showing we are able to reach a mean absolute error of ~0.05 eV relative to DFT in only 43 DFT calculations, only about ~3x the cost of the running isolated calculations for the same configurations. Further, we demonstrate our approach on ammonia decomposition on Pt(111) with N* as a co-adsorbate and for the initial reactions for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on Ru(0001) with OC* as the co-adsorbate. We show the importance for including these coverage dependent corrections in the ammonia decomposition case and examine the SIDT-predicted minimum energy configurations for O* on Ru(0001) in detail. Lastly, we discuss how to get the most accuracy out of the fewest calculations within this framework.  </p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Catalysis; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Heterogeneous Catalysis | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

To overcome this barrier, we present a variational quantum algorithm capable of solving generalized form time-local quantum master equations directly on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) processors. Our approach combines four key innovations: (1) a pair-vector stochastic Schr¨odinger equation tounravel time-local quantum master equations, (2) deterministic evolution projected onto parameterized circuitsvia McLachlan’s principle and stochasitc jump implementation via singular-value decomposition, (3) usingHadamard tests circuits to measure the jump rates and the element of reduced density matrices and (4) usingno-evolution sampling to sample trajectories. The resulting protocol remains resilient under realistic hardwarenoise. We validate it on both classical simulators and a 66-qubit superconducting processor for solving Redfield master equation and fourth-order time-local non-Markovian master equation and find that it can successfully capture key features of complex open quantum dynamics - including non-Markovian oscillations and strong-coupling effects. Our approach establishes a practical pathway toward scalable simulations of open quantum systems in the NISQ era.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[]</p></details> |

We introduce a rigorous protocol for benchmarking DFAs for nonadiabatic dynamics regarding the initialization, the dynamics, and its evaluation. Different families of DFAs were compared with a high-level reference, highlighting that electronic populations are an unsuitable metric for evaluating the accuracy of dynamics. We found that several local functionals showed the best agreement of the population decay with the reference RMS-CASPT2, but strictly passed through a deactivation channel dominated by a single-bond torsion that is not accessible in the reference and in the literature.  While using 100% Hartree-Fock exchange in the functional yields the only correct isomerization behaviour, the time scales and quantum yields are far off the reference values, due to an artificial local minimum being predicted along the wrong torsion coordinate.  Static energy scans suggest that this issue can be circumvented by double hybrid functionals, in particular those balancing nonlocal exchange and correlation combined with range-separation. Indeed, they predict energy profiles along the two torsion coordinates in close agreement with the RMS-CASPT2 reference. This emphasizes the impact these DFAs will have on the field of nonadiabatic dynamics once analytical gradients are introduced.</p></details> | Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[{"title": "Supporting Information for: Benchmarking density functional approximations in nonadiabatic dynamics: trans-cis isomerization in retinal model", "assetLink": "https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68cc217823be8e43d6f61259/original/supporting-information-for-benchmarking-density-functional-approximations-in-nonadiabatic-dynamics-trans-cis-isomerization-in-retinal-model.pdf"}]</p></details> |
